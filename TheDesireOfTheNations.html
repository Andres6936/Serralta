TRANSLATIONS OF THE BIBLE: THE DESIRE OF THE NATIONS AND THE WEALTH OF
THE NATIONS.</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This passage of
the Old Testament ( Hg 2: 6- 9 ) <b>proves that Jesus is the long awaited
Messiah</b>, who was to come to Israel to be sacrificed for the redemption
of our sins.&nbsp; For some decades a great number of&nbsp; "wise linguists"&nbsp;
have existed, who disguise themselves as&nbsp; "honest" and&nbsp; "objective"&nbsp;
translators of the Bible.&nbsp; Their job is to change some key words in
order to make a Bible that fits Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;
These translators and seminar professors say that the word&nbsp; "desire"&nbsp;
which has appeared for centuries in our Bibles must be changed for the
word&nbsp; "wealth".&nbsp; Suddenly they have&nbsp; "discovered"&nbsp;
that all the translators of centuries past were ignoramus who did not know
Hebrew.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to
these modern ecumenical translators, Haggai, instead of prophesying that
<b>"the desire of the nations"</b>,&nbsp; the Messiah,&nbsp; Jesus Christ,
was going to come to the Temple they were building, they say that what
Haggai was prophesying was that the wealth of the nations was going to
come to that Temple.&nbsp; According to them, this passage instead of saying
that the&nbsp; "Desire of Nations"&nbsp; was going to come to that Temple,
it must say that the&nbsp; "wealth of nations"&nbsp; was going to come
to that Temple.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is evident
that they are trying to accomplish their task by voiding the passage of
its messianic contents.&nbsp; With this change it will become an adequate
passage for Muslims, Jews, Buddhists and any other religion that do not
accept Christ as their Messiah.&nbsp; The saddest thing is that there are
many Christian seminar professors and Christian publishing houses that
back this evil effort. Let us read the passage.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"<i>For thus saith the LORD of hosts: Yet once, it is a little while, and
<b>I
will</b></i></font>
<br><b><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
shake <u>the heavens</u>, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;
</font></i></b><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">and
I will</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
shake all nations, and <b>the desire of all nations <u>shall come</u>;
and I will fill</b></font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
this house with glory</b>, saith the LORD of hosts. The silver is mine,
and the</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
gold is mine, saith the LORD of&nbsp; hosts. <b>The glory of this latter
house shall</b></font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
be greater than of the former,</b> saith the LORD of hosts: and in this
place</font></i>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
will I give peace, saith the LORD of hosts</i>."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Hag&nbsp; 2: 6-9)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even a person
who does not know a single word in Hebrew or Greek, <b>can prove that this
modern translation is wrong.&nbsp;</b> Anyone can see that <b>it is an
evil attempt to diminish the power of that Messianic prophecy</b>, or at
least, in the best scenario, a huge blunder.&nbsp; Let us reason together.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>First</u>.</b>&nbsp;
As we read the passage we can realize that the verb&nbsp; "to come"&nbsp;
is properly used <b>only if </b>the phrase&nbsp; "the Desire of nations"&nbsp;
refers to Jesus Christ.&nbsp; A person can come to the Temple by himself.&nbsp;
On the contrary, the wealth of the nations <b>cannot come by itself; it
has to be brought</b>.&nbsp; It seems that he who altered the word&nbsp;
"desire",&nbsp; and changed it for&nbsp; "wealth",&nbsp; forgot to alter
the verb&nbsp; "to come".&nbsp; If the word that existed in Hebrew would
be&nbsp; "wealth",&nbsp; the prophet would have used the verb&nbsp; "to
bring"&nbsp; not the verb&nbsp; "to come".</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Second</u>.</b>&nbsp;
Anyone who believes in God knows that <b>His prophets never erred</b>.&nbsp;
If Haggai, who lived before the coming of Christ, wrote the phrase <b>"The
Desire of all Nations",&nbsp; referring to Christ, he was right because
Jesus came to that Temple</b>;&nbsp; and this coming filled that house
of glory.&nbsp; But <b>if he wrote the word "wealth", then he was miserably
wrong, because the prophecy did not happen.</b>&nbsp; The wealth of the
nations was never brought to that Temple.&nbsp; No real believer would
accept that Haggai failed in his prophecy.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also it is ludicrous
to think that <b>God was going to shake the heavens, and the earth, and
the sea, and the dry land because of the wealth that was going to be brought
to that Temple.</b>&nbsp; It is evident that the word "wealth" does not
match with the context.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>It was Rome,
the Roman Empire who got the wealth of the nations during that period of
history.</b>&nbsp; That Temple was destroyed, and the wealth of the nations
was never brought to it. Therefore, if we believe these&nbsp; "experts",&nbsp;
these&nbsp; "modern"&nbsp; translators we have reach to the conclusion
that poor prophet Haggai failed, and also He who inspired him.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>On the contrary,
if we believe the translators who did their work before the&nbsp; "ecumenism",</b>
those ancient translators that always translated&nbsp; "the Desire of the
Nations",&nbsp; <b>then the prophecy was fulfilled,</b> because: <b>a)</b>
the Messiah,&nbsp; Jesus Christ,
<b><u>came</u></b> to that Temple;&nbsp;
<b>b)</b> the <b>Earth and the heavens were shaken</b> with the First Coming
of Jesus Christ;&nbsp; <b>c)</b> with the coming of Christ at the Temple
that they were constructing in the moment of the prophecy, that Temple
was <b>filled with glory;&nbsp; d)</b> the glory of the Second Temple was
greater than that of the first, as Haggai said,
<b>because Jesus came to
the Second Temple</b>, and never came to the First Temple, even though
it had a lot more riches.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why in
Hag&nbsp; 2: 8 God says: "The <b>silver</b> is mine, and the <b>gold</b>
is mine, saith the LORD of hosts";&nbsp; meaning that if He wanted He could
fill this Second Temple of gold and silver.&nbsp; But God did not want
it to be so.&nbsp; The glory of this Temple was going to consist in the
fact that Jesus was going to come to it, not in having more gold than the
former one.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>With persecutions
and massacres Satan never could destroy Christianity, therefore, he joined
it to destroy it from the inside out, little by little, eroding it.</b></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Third</u>.</b>&nbsp;
If this passage is translated with the word&nbsp; "Desire"&nbsp; as it
always had been, it agrees with Malachi 3:1 that announces that the Lord
was going to come to his Temple.&nbsp; On the contrary, if it is translated
with the word&nbsp; "wealth",&nbsp; it does not agree with any other passage
in the Bible, it becomes singular, unconnected.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"<i>Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before
me:</i></font>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and <b>the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly <u>come</u> to his Temple,</b>
even the messenger</font></i>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of the covenant, whom ye delight in, behold, he shall come, saith the LORD
of hosts</i>."</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Mal 3:1 )</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Fourth</u>.</b>&nbsp;
The real reason behind this fairy tale that these translators have spread
among Christians
<b>is to weaken a prophecy that points to Jesus.</b>&nbsp;
Sadly many Christians believe this fairy tale, including the editors of
the New American Standard Version and others.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This fairy tale
says that the Second Temple was constructed by Herod, or at least, that
he worked on it so much, that he made it greater and richer than the one
built by Solomon.&nbsp; They invented this fairy tale to be able to later&nbsp;
"demonstrate"&nbsp; that the prophecy&nbsp; <b>"agrees" with an inexistent
"reality":
</b>that the wealth of the Second Temple was greater than the
First One.&nbsp; This is not true, let's see why.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Herod was
a <u>vassal of Rome</u>, a kinglet of third category that only reigned
over <u>a little section of Palestine,</u></b> a kinglet that had to send
the wealth of the country to Rome. <b>Therefore, it is ludicrous to say
that such man could build a Temple wealthier and bigger than Solomon's.</b></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solomon was a
great king who <b>reigned over all of Palestine and several nearby nations,</b>
see verse 26<b>.&nbsp;</b> He also had several other vassal kings bringing
him presents, see verse 24.&nbsp; He personally possessed a great wealth
according to the Word of God, see verses 20-22.&nbsp; Silver was as common
as stones during his kingdom, see verse 27.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"</i><font size=-2>20 </font><i>And <b><u>all </u>the drinking vessels
of king Solomon <u>were of gold</u>, and <u>all</u></b></i></font>
<br><b><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were <u>of pure gold;</u>
none</font></i></b>
<br><b><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
were of silver; <u>it was not any thing accounted of</u> in the days of
Solomon.</font></i></b>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</i><font size=-2>21 </font><i>For the king's ships went to Tarshish with
the servants of Huram;</i></font>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen;
whom</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</font></i>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

( II Chronicles&nbsp; 9:20-27 )</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides Solomon's
personal capabilities and wealth, his father David left a large quantity
of gold, silver and other metals for the construction of the First Temple,
see I Chronicles 29:1-8.</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<i><font size=-2>1

<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>I have prepared with

stones to be set, <b>glistering stones</b>, and of divers colours,</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and all manner of <b>precious
stones</b>, and marble stones in abundance.</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<font size=-2>3
</font>Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God,
I have</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of mine own proper good,
of gold and silver, which I have given to the house</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of my God, over and above
all that I have prepared for the holy house, <font size=-2>4 </font>Even</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>three thousand talents
of gold</b>, of the gold of Ophir, and <b>seven thousand</b></i>
<br><i><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; talents of refined
silver,</b> to overlay the walls of the houses withal:&nbsp; <font size=-2>5

gold</i>

thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of iron. <font size=-2>8
</font>And
they <b>with whom precious stones were found gave them</b> to the</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; treasure of the house
of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite</i>."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( I Chronicles 29:1-8 )
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>After knowing
all these <u>facts</u>,</b> can someone try to convince us that Herod,
a kinglet vassal of Rome, that had to send the wealth of the country he
ruled to his superiors in Rome, did a better job than Solomon?&nbsp; Absurd!&nbsp;
Ludicrous!&nbsp; Illogical!&nbsp; Why then this "modern" translation.&nbsp;
Is it ignorance, stupidity or evil plans?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Fifth</u>.</b>&nbsp;
In I Chronicles 28: 3 we read that David wanted to build the Temple, but
God forbade him because he was a man of war and shed blood.&nbsp; Even
though these bloods were in general shed in just wars, God forbade him.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"<i>But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build a house for my name, because
thou</i></font>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
hast been a man of war, <b>and hast shed blood.</b></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( I Chronicles&nbsp; 28: 3 )</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could anyone in
their right mind think that God forbade a man like David to build His Temple,
but rewarded a murderer like Herod in letting him build a better temple
than Solomon's?&nbsp; Could you believe that a man, who murdered lots of
infants in order to kill the Messiah, was blessed by God with the construction
of a better temple than the one Solomon built?&nbsp; It is like saying
that Adolf Hitler was blessed by God bestowing on him the glory of building
a better Temple than Solomon's.&nbsp; Would God base the glory of His Second
Temple in the wealth and constructions of a callous murderer?&nbsp; Was
God going to forbid David, who was a prophet and a Hebrew, but remunerate
Herod who was a murderer and was not a Hebrew but an Edomite?&nbsp; <b>Does
this make sense?</b></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Sixth</u>.&nbsp;</b>
Saint Paul, in the Epistle to the Hebrews says that this prophecy of Haggai,
where he says that heaven and earth would be shaken, refers to Jesus.&nbsp;
Therefore, it does not refer to the wealth of the nations.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"<i>Whose voice then shook the earth; but now he hath promised, saying,
Yet once</i></font>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
more <b>I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.</b> And this word,
Yet once more,</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that
are made,</font></i>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
that those things which cannot be shaken may remain</i>."</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Heb 12: 26-27 )</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, according
to these modern translators, who are&nbsp; "experts"&nbsp; in the Hebrew
language, we have to believe that none of the ancient translators, who
were closer to those times and to those languages, knew a thing.&nbsp;
Now we have to believe that who really know these languages are the ecumenical
translators.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sadly there are
many brothers who have been confused by these "experts".&nbsp; A sad example
of how the brethren fall in the snare of these translators is&nbsp; found
in the teacher's&nbsp; manual for Sunday Schools, in the lesson for Sunday
September 7, 1986, pages 72-73.&nbsp; In the lesson for that day teachers
are told that what was going to enter in the Temple was&nbsp; "the wealth
of the nations" and not&nbsp; "the Desire of all the Nations".&nbsp; According
to them, Haggai's prophecy was referring to the wealth of the nations.
<b>It
is sad that the writers of these manuals make such errors.&nbsp; If they
just read more of the Bible, and read less of the&nbsp; "experts"&nbsp;
books, and used a little more of their common sense, they could avoid teaching
their brethren an error.</b></font>
<br><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These horrible
mistakes are due to a lack of inspection and supervision from the editor
and production team, and the passive silence of those that lead Christian
denominations.</font></b>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to hammer
in&nbsp; the pieces that don't belong to the puzzle, they allege that the
phrase&nbsp; <b><i>"I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea,
and the dry land"</i>&nbsp;</b> meant the political problems during the
Persian Empire.&nbsp; But as we have seen in Heb 12: 26-27,&nbsp; Paul
himself interpreted that this shaking was referring to the coming of Christ.&nbsp;
Therefore it was not referring <b>to the political problems, that besides
<u>could
never shake the heavens</u>.</b></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Seventh</u>.&nbsp;</b>
It is silly to think that the earth was going to be shaken because of the
wealth of the nations being brought to the Temple.&nbsp;<b> It is absolute
foolishness to think that because of the "wealth of the nations" being
brought to the Temple, <u>the heavens would be shaken</u>.</b>&nbsp; Do
these people think that those that are in heaven care about gold and silver?&nbsp;
Therefore, it becomes evident that the phrase&nbsp; "the Desire of Nations"&nbsp;
is the correct translation, not the "wealth of the nations",&nbsp; <b>because
only the coming of Jesus did shake even the heavens.</b> Let us read again
the passage.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"<i>For thus saith the LORD of hosts: Yet once, it is a little while, and
<b><u>I
will</u></b></i></font>
<br><b><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>shake
the heavens,</u> and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;</font></i></b><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">
and I will shake</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill
this house</font></i>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
with glory, saith the LORD of hosts</i>."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Hag&nbsp; 2: 6-7 )</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This trick of
changing to&nbsp; "the wealth of the nations", instead of&nbsp; "the Desire
of Nations",&nbsp; is just a concession of protestant publishing companies
to Islamism, Judaism, Bhudism, etc., for ecumenical and economical motives.&nbsp;
This prophecy of Haggai is an irrefutable one.&nbsp; It stands against
the ecumenism, which is why it is necessary for them to get rid of it.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The business
of businessmen is to make business.&nbsp; That is why <b>many&nbsp; "Christian"
publishing companies do not care about the truth of God.</b>&nbsp; They
care about their business because they are in business, not in the Truth.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another falsehood
some are trying to introduce among Christians is to take the word&nbsp;
"virgin" which appears in Isa 7:14, and change it for the word&nbsp; "young
lady".&nbsp; For this case see the biblical note referring to that passage,
which will appear in this same website.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Please brethren;
don't let anyone fool you. Be alert.&nbsp;</b> Don't take as true everything
that someone tells you, not even your religious leaders, or Christian Scholars.&nbsp;
The swindlers that can swindle you are those who do not have a swindler's
face, but those who look like decent people.&nbsp; By the same token the
religious leaders that can cheat you are those who seem to be spiritual
and honest.&nbsp; Don't look at the outside of David's older brother, look
at the Bible, read it daily, continuously and use your common sense.</font>
