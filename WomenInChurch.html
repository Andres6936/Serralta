<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Why
Paul forbade women from participating in some Church activities.</span></b> </p>

<p>It is easy to prove that Paul forbade women from having preaching or
authority positions in church, because it is overtly said, but to explain why
he did it, is not that easy. Nevertheless, elder ladies could have those
positions in Church as we will later see. We can make assumptions and guesses
about the reason for Paul's commandment, but it is not clearly stated.
Nevertheless, we could theorize about it. Let's first take a look at those
verses where Paul forbade women to participate in some Church activities. </p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.2in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.2in;
margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;34 <b>Let
your women keep silence in the churches; for it is not permitted unto them to
speak</b>; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also says the law.
35 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home; for
it is a shame for women to speak in the
church.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( I Co 14: 34-35 )</i> </p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.2in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.2in;
margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.2in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.2in;
margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;<i>11 <b>Let
the woman learn in silence</b> with all subjection. 12 But I<b> suffer not a
woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man</b>, but to be in silence</i>.&quot;&nbsp;
( I Tim 2: 11-12 ) </p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>According to Paul's words women should not have
teaching positions nor authority positions in churches.</b> The reason for this
could be twofold: a) to avoid subversion of authority in marriage, and b) to
avoid problems caused by the beauty of young ladies. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>If a married lady is a pastor</b>, or has some
position of authority in the church, she will also have some sort of indirect
authority over her husband. That is the message that I Tim 2: 12 seems to
convey. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>A second motivation could be that young ladies are
attractive, and many men would fix their attention more on their physical
characteristics than on their teachings.</b> This would also provoke the
jealousy of other women, who see how their husbands fix too much attention on
their beautiful pastor. In short, it would be, at least, a factor of
distraction in church, if not a factor of divisions and conflicts. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we read Ro 16: 1 we will see that sister Phoebe was
deaconess at Cenchreas church, which proves that <b>women were not totally
banned from church positions.</b> Evidently, women were not banned from certain
Church positions just for being women. Why did she have such a position? She
was probably an older woman. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In I Tim 5: 9 we learn that Paul's recommendation is not
to accept any widow who is less than 60 years old, the reason being is that
younger widows began to wax wanton as he says in verse 11. His recommendation
for those younger ladies was to marry and bear children, as he says in verse
14. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>What Paul says in these verses is a hint of what was
on his mind in respect to women in the church.</b> It seems that he did not
like young beautiful women in any position. After 60, a lady was seen as a
mother, or as a sister, not as an attractive female; therefore, they could have
any position in the church, if they were widows. Otherwise, a lady must be
taking care of her husband and her household. A widow over sixty, who does not
have any duties at home, which is not of those who still want to be
&quot;attractive&quot;, is suitable for Church service; but not a lady who has
to take care of her children and husband. </p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.2in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.2in;
margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&quot;</b><span
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>9<b> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Let
not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old</i></b></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>, having been the wife of one man, 10 well
reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged
strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the
afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work. 11 But <b>the
younger widows refuse; for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ,
they will marry;</b> 12 having damnation, because they have cast off their
first faith. 13 And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to
house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things
which they ought not. 14 <b>I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear
children,</b> guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak
reproachfully</i>.&quot; ( I Tim 5: 9-14 ) </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>As we read in this passage, Paul evidently feared the
problems caused by sexual attraction of young ladies, and the disturbances it
entails within the Church.</b> That is why he advised churches against this
danger. Other advice that Paul gave, was that young widows should remarry,
probably to avoid sexual problems and scandals within the church, when they
felt the natural drive of the flesh. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>It is reasonable that if Paul did not want ladies
under sixty to form the inside crew of the church, much less was he going to
like or allow ladies under sixty to be teachers or Church officials.</b> </p>
