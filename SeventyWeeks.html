  <B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><SPAN style='font-size:18.0pt'>Daniel's
  prophecy of the 70 weeks of years tells us the time of the coming of the
  Messiah<o:p></o:p></SPAN></B>
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </SPAN><B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Daniel's prophecy of the seventy
  weeks is one of the prophecies that show with great precision that the Lord
  Jesus is the Messiah.</B> This prophecy indicates the time from when
  <SPAN class=SpellE>Artaxerxes</SPAN> king of
  <st1:country-region w:st="on">Persia</st1:country-region> gave permission
  to Nehemiah for the reconstruction of
  <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:place></st1:City>
  until the coming of the Messiah. This is what we will consider in this article.
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </SPAN><B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Since we now use the word "week"
  only to indicate the lapse of seven days,</B> it is important to first
  demonstrate that in the time of Moses and the prophets, the word also was
  used in the sense of a period of seven years.
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>In Genesis 29:27-28,
  we <SPAN class=GramE>see,</SPAN> that from very early times, one of the
  <B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>biblical meanings</B> for the word
  "week" was as a period of seven years. Here the word
  <B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>"week" is related <U>directly</U>
  to a period of seven years. </B>This is important to establish, because the
  meaning of "week" in this case is the key for the interpretation of the prophecy
  of the Seventy Weeks.
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </SPAN><B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>After Jacob was deceived by

  him Rachel.

  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>As we saw in this
  passage, a period of seven years is called a "week."
  <B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Again in Leviticus 25:8 we see that

  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>We see again in
  the verse we just read that the word "week" (or equivalent "Sabbath) is also
  used to indicate a period of seven years. Now that we are aware of the ancient
  use of the word "week" to indicate a period of seven years, let's read a
  prophecy from the ninth chapter of the book of the prophet Daniel.
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>At the beginning
  of the chapter we see Daniel seeking the will of God and praying for it.
  We learn this as we read the first twenty-three verses of the chapter where
  an angel appeared which made the following revelation. As you carefully analyze
  this revelation, you will find that the revelation in
  <B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

  </SPAN>(Dn 9:24-27)
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>From this very important
  passage of Daniel's prophecy we can come to the conclusion that God was revealing
  that the Jewish people were to pass through three distinct periods.
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </SPAN><B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The first period was the seven
  <SPAN class=GramE>weeks<SPAN style='font-weight:normal'>,
  that</SPAN></SPAN></B> is the 49 years while they will turn to building the
  plaza (street) and wall during trying times. This occurred in Nehemiah's
  time, you only have to read the book of Nehemiah in the Bible to confirm
  this.
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </SPAN><B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The second period was the
  seventy-two weeks</B>, which comes to 434 years. Adding the first period
  of 49 years to the 434 years adds up to 483 (49+434=483). After the 483 years
  the Messiah will come according to verse 25. After His coming, they will
  take His life as verse 26 clearly states. Afterwards the City of
  <st1:City w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:City> and its
  <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Temple</st1:place></st1:City> will
  be destroyed.
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </SPAN><B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>From this reading of Daniel's
  prophecy, we can conclude that: <o:p></o:p></B>
  <P>
  <B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </SPAN>a) </B>God has decreed a period of 70 weeks of years for the people
  of
  <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
  <P>
  <B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </SPAN>b) </B>The Messiah will arrive (69 weeks) 483 years after the order
  is given for the restoration of
  <SPAN style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </SPAN><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:place></st1:City>.

  </SPAN>c)</B> The Messiah will be killed following the 483 years after the
  order to restore
  <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:place></st1:City>.
  <P>
  <B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </SPAN>d)</B> After the Messiah's life is taken, the City of
  <st1:City w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:City> and the
  <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Temple</st1:place></st1:City> will
  be destroyed which
  <SPAN style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>happened
  when Titus Flavius, the son of the Emperor
  <SPAN class=SpellE>Vespasian</SPAN> razed the city.
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </SPAN><B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>e)</B> After these two periods
  which add up to 69 weeks, there remains
  <B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>a future third period of one
  <SPAN style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>week of years when Israel
  will again enter into God's prophecy.</B>
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </SPAN><B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><U>These will be the final
  seven years of the history of the world.</U></B> The first three years and
  six months of these seven years will be distinguished by the appearance of
  what the Book of Revelation (in the New Testament) calls "the two witnesses."
  These are two of God's prophets that will perform miracles like in the ancient
  times did Elijah. After the first three and a half years, the
  <SPAN class=SpellE>antiChrist</SPAN> will appear and rule for forty-two months
  (three years and a half). This figure will kill God's two witnesses and will
  make the people believe that he is the messiah. Then he will demand that
  the people worship him as a god and require that they mark themselves with
  the number 666 which many will do.
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </SPAN><B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>When should we begin to count
  the 483 years?</B> Knowing what Daniel's prophecy says, we are able to
  demonstrate how the prophecy of the Messiah is fulfilled by Jesus Christ.
  But, to know when the 483 years finish, we first need to know when the period
  begins.
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>According to Daniel's
  prophecy, "<B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><U>from</U></B> the going
  forth of the commandment to restore and
  <B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>to build
  <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on"><SPAN class=GramE><U>Jerusalem</U></SPAN></st1:City></st1:place></B><SPAN
      class=GramE>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</SPAN><B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><U>unto</U></B></SPAN><B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'> the
  Messiah and Prince</B>, there will be seven weeks, and threescore and two
  weeks" for a total of 69 weeks of years. Therefore, let's go to Scripture
  to find out, there we will find when this command was given.
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </SPAN><B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Nehemiah 2:1-6 turns out to
  be one of the most important passages in relation to the Messiah. We base
  the prophecy of the seventy weeks of years</B> that is found in Daniel 9:24-27
  on the date given in Nehemiah for the beginning of this period. Both passages
  together form a magnificent way to prove to Jews that Jesus is the Messiah
  in His First Coming and to prove to atheists that the Bible is a book from
  God as we shall see.
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>At the beginning
  of chapter two of Nehemiah, we see he appears during the twentieth year of
  <SPAN class=SpellE>Artaxerxes</SPAN>' rule. At this time
  <st1:City w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:City> is still destroyed due to
  Nebuchadnezzar's siege at the time when Zedekiah was king of
  <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Judah</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
  We know this from Nehemiah 1:3 and from the details of what Nehemiah said
  to the king <SPAN class=SpellE>Artaxerxes</SPAN> in Nehemiah 2:3-5. In these
  verses we find evidence that:
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </SPAN><B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>a)</B> The people were living
  in affliction and reproach. <B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The walls

  <SPAN style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>the gates
  burned. <o:p></o:p></B>
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </SPAN><B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>b) The city was deserted and
  very few were living there.</B>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</SPAN>This is confirmed by Nehemiah
  11:1-<SPAN style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp; </SPAN>2 where we learn of a kind
  of compulsory levy to recruit inhabitants for
  <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:City></st1:place>.
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </SPAN><B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>c)</B> Nehemiah asks the king
  <B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>directly</B> to be sent to rebuild
  <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:place></st1:City>
  which is certainly a sign that
  <SPAN style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </SPAN>the city had not yet been reconstructed. In addition we can confirm
  in this passage that
  <SPAN style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </SPAN><B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>King
  <SPAN class=SpellE>Artaxerxes</SPAN> was giving Nehemiah the order to rebuild
  as well as the means and <SPAN style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </SPAN>authority to do so.</B>
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>As a result there
  cannot be the least doubt that the
  "<B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><U>commandment to restore and to
  rebuild <st1:City w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:City></U> took place during the
  twentieth year of the rule of king <SPAN class=SpellE>Artaxerxes</SPAN> of

  </SPAN><B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Now we turn to the Encyclopedia

  <SPAN class=SpellE>Artaxerxes</SPAN> I, the king who gave the order to "restore
  and rebuild
  <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:place></st1:City>",
  ruled from the year 465 to 425 B.C. If this monarch began to rule in the
  year 465, then his twentieth year of rule would be 445 B.C. We already know
  that the biblical and historical chronology is not real precise, but even
  so, it can be used as a basis for finding the truth.
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>If from the twentieth
  year of <SPAN class=SpellE>Artaxerxes</SPAN> rule (445 B.C.) until the Messiah,

  <B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>we fall in the year 38 A.D. (after
  Christ)</B>. In other words even with the imprecision of the chronology,
  our calculations place us in the epoch of Jesus Christ.
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </SPAN><B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Even if someone objects that
  the calculations fall in the year 38 and not in the year 33,</B> when Christ

  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </SPAN><B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>a) </B>The five year difference

  Christ. <o:p></o:p></B>
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>In other words,
  our problem is not to try to see which of three or four contemporary
  personalities of the epoch better fit with the prophetic chronology. If there
  had been other "messiahs" with the religious stature of Christ, there could
  have been some doubts; but that did not happen. He was unique among all the
  people of that entire period. Therefore it is logical to conclude that He
  was the one who fulfilled the time which was prophesied even though at this
  distance of time there is a small divergence in the calculation. In reality
  true believers in the Hebrew Scriptures have two alternatives:
  <B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>a)</B> Either Jesus is the Messiah in His First Coming,
  <SPAN class=GramE>or
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</SPAN><B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

  Daniel miserably failed in his prediction, something that a Jewish believer
  would consider to be blasphemy.

  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </SPAN><B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Once all of this is understood,
  we can say that any honest atheist who wishes to reason through this
  matter,</B> who has an interest in investigating the truth, must realize
  that here lies <B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>a proof of the divine
  origin of the Bible</B>. The two passages that prove that Jesus fulfills
  the prophecy about the Messiah belong to the Old Testament; they belong to
  portion of the Bible that the Jews accept and administrate.
  <B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>No atheist can suspect that these
  passages were "fixed" so that they would be in agreement with the coming
  of Jesus Christ</B>, since: <B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>1)</B> the orthodox Jews do not "fix" the Scriptures; and
  <B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>2)</B> even in the case of an alteration,
  it would never be done in order to demonstrate that Jesus is the Messiah.
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>Therefore, if the
  proofs of the coming of the Christ were precisely prophesied based on passages
  that could not have been "arranged", it would be right to think that the
  prophecy has been fulfilled. And <B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>if
  a singular, unique event was prophesied 483 years before its occurrence,
  then one must conclude that the book that contains the prophecy is not and
  cannot be a humanly inspired work.</B>

  more proofs that the Bible is God's book, then he can read my book "The Last
  Four World Powers" that can be found on my website: www.bibleserralta.com.
  In this book I present the evidences from outside of the Bible that show
  how the prophecy contained in chapter 7 of the biblical book of Daniel the
  Prophet is being fulfilled in our time. This prophecy which was made nearly
  three thousand years ago states that the last four great powers of the world
  will be <st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region>,

  </SPAN><SPAN class=GramE><B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Back to the

  the
  <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Temple</st1:place></st1:City>. The
  order for rebuilding the Temple</B> had been given years before by Cyrus
  (Ezra 1:1-4). Also, it was <SPAN class=SpellE>Artaxerxes</SPAN>, who in addition
  to giving permission and troops, as well gave construction materials for
  rebuilding the city and the wall as we have seen in Nehemiah 2:8-9.
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>As if to confirm
  the double use of the word "week", we see a little more ahead in the same
  book of Daniel where he <B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>mentions weeks
  of days</B>. Because he was fasting during those weeks, they cannot be weeks
  of years.

  <B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>I ate no pleasant bread, neither came

  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>All of this obvious
  reasoning and data demonstrate that it was customary to speak in terms of
  weeks of years. In addition, any Jewish person that believes in the Old Testament
  as the Word of <SPAN class=GramE>God,</SPAN> must conclude that if the prophecy
  of the 70 weeks referred to weeks of days, then the prophecy would not have
  been fulfilled. I say this because
  <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:City></st1:place>
  was not destroyed a bit more than a year (seventy weeks of days) after the
  beginning of its reconstruction <B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>as
  the prophecy states.</B> Since any true believer believes that God's prophecies
  do not fail, it is necessary to accept that the reference is to weeks of
  years. Indeed, it was a little more than 483 years after its reconstruction
  that the city and sanctuary were destroyed, a proof that the weeks in question
  were weeks <B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>of years</B>.
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>Let's situate ourselves
  in the time of Hebrew history that occurred 483 years after the order for
  the reconstruction and rebuilding of
  <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:place></st1:City>.
  During this time period no one of messianic stature arose except for Jesus
  Christ. No one can show a prophet, chief priest or leader,
  <SPAN class=GramE>nor</SPAN> any other personage that fulfills the prophecy
  of the seventy weeks like Jesus. Why not accept Jesus as the Messiah then?
  Because of what your friends could say or think? The larger problem is what
  God could think when you present yourself before Him and He asks why you
  did not believe in His Word, and why you preferred the approval of your friends
  before the approval of your Father God.
  <P>
  <B style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </SPAN>Summary: </B>The prophecy of the seventy weeks of years in the book
  of Daniel, chapter 9, accurately shows when the Messiah was to come. The
  two passages from Genesis 29:27-28 and Leviticus 25:8 show how the word "week"
  in the biblical epoch was used to indicate a seven year amount of time. Then
  in Daniel 9:24-27 we see how the prophet Daniel announced that the Messiah
  was to come 69 weeks of years (483 years) after the command for the restoration
  of
  <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:place></st1:City>.
  After this period they would kill the Messiah and afterwards the
  <st1:City w:st="on">Temple</st1:City> would be destroyed as well as the City
  of
  <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:place></st1:City>.
  However, there remained a final week of years that were for the future when
  God would again manifest himself to
  <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
  Of these seven years of the last week, during the first 3&amp;frac12; years,
  God would show himself through two witnesses that are described in the New
  Testament book of Revelation. One of these two prophets could be Elijah.
  We should not forget that according to Malachi, Elijah is to return. During
  the second half of the week (the second 3&amp;frac12; years) the
  <SPAN class=SpellE>antiChrist</SPAN> is to reign and will impose his 666
  number. He will be accepted by many and rejected by others.
  <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>Afterwards we saw
  in Nehemiah 2:1-6 that in his twentieth year of rule,
  <SPAN class=SpellE>Artaxerxes</SPAN> King of
  <st1:country-region w:st="on">Persia</st1:country-region>, gave the order
  to restore
  <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jerusalem</st1:place></st1:City>
  and he gave Nehemiah authority and resources to do that. Knowing that according
  to the Encyclopedia the 20th year of this king is approximately the year
  445 before Christ, it is easy to calculate <SPAN class=GramE>that</SPAN>
  483 years from then would fall during the year 38 of our Christian era. The
  only person of messianic stature that appeared during this time was Jesus
  Christ. One would have to willfully not believe in order to not accept this
  proof.
