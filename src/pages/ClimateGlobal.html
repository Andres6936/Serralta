<p><strong>ERRONEOUS HYPOTHESIS OF ONE SAME</strong></p>
<p><strong>GLOBAL CLIMATE YEAR ROUND.</strong></p>
<p> Some individuals have a hypothesis that before The Great Flood the climate was the same all year round throughout
    the Earth. They base their erroneous hypothesis of one same global climate on another hypothesis: The idea that
    before the Great Flood a misty blanket of water covered the planet. They says this so called misty blanket created a
    green house effect which distributed heat evenly throughout the Earth. What they never told me is on what they base
    this hypothesis of a thick blanket of clouds covering the Earth.</p>
<p><strong>First of all</strong>, we have to realize that <strong>there was no such blanket of clouds</strong>, because
    the sun, moon and the stars were seen. In Gn 1:14 says that these heavenly hosts will serve to divide the day from
    the night, for seasons, for days and for years. <strong>Secondly</strong>, in Gn 1:16 states that the greater light
    would <strong>rule the day</strong> and the lesser light would <strong>rule the night</strong>. From this we can
    deduce that <strong>the moon could be clearly seen at night</strong>, something that doesn't occur on a semi cloudy
    night. <strong>How then "ruled the night"</strong> if a cloudy blanket much thicker than what exist today covered
    the Earth, hiding the moon? Besides, according to vers 14, these heavenly bodies were going to be used as signs. How
    could they be signs if they couldn't be seen because of the clouds? For example, months were known by the phases of
    the moon.</p>
<p><strong>The seasons of the year would not be mentioned</strong> in Gn 1:14, if there were no seasons before the Great
    Flood. Therefore, if there were seasons (summer, winter, etc.,) <strong>there was no "one same global climate" all
        year long.</strong></p>
<p> "<strong>While</strong> <i>the Earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and <strong>cold</strong> and
    <strong>heat</strong>, and <strong>summer</strong> and <strong>winter</strong>, and day and night <strong>shall not
        cease</strong></i>." ( Gn 8:22 )</p>
<p></p>
<p> "<i>14 And God said: Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and
    <strong>let them be for signs, and for seasons</strong>, and for days, and years; 15 and let them be for lights in
    the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. 16 And God made two great lights; the
    greater light <strong>to rule the day</strong>, and the lesser light <strong>to rule the night</strong>; he made
    <strong>the stars also. 17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth</strong></i>"
    ( Gn 1:14-17 )</p>
<p> Whoever has been in a farm, far away from any city, or in a desert on a clear cloudless night, with no moon shining,
    knows <strong>the great amount of light that the stars give over the face of the Earth</strong>. They give so much
    light that it allows us, in the middle of the night, to walk around and see ourselves. On a cloudy night however,
    it's very different. Even if the moon was out we would not be able to see our own hands, because the moon light
    could not shine through the thick clouds. Knowing this, therefore, when we read verse 17, where it says that God put
    the stars in heaven "…to give light upon the Earth…", we can conclude that before the Great Flood there was no such
    blanket of clouds as some claim, <strong>because the stars shined over the face of the earth</strong>.</p>
<p> In Gn 8:22, it clearly states that immediately after the Great Flood God says: "<strong>While</strong> <i>the Earth
    remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and <strong>cold and heat, and summer and winter</strong>, and day and night
    <strong>shall not cease</strong></i>". When it says While seedtime and harvest, day and night will continue, implies
    that before the Great Flood the seedtime and harvest, day and night did exist. Therefore, <strong>in the same
        manner, the cold and the heat, summer and winter did exist before the Great Flood</strong>.</p>
<p> In this Devine affirmation it states "<strong>While</strong>…", because before that time these things existed. If
    they would not have existed prior to the Great Flood, it would not say "<strong>While</strong>…" rather it would say
    "<strong>From now on</strong>…".</p>
<p> In the same manner when it says "…<strong>shall not cease</strong>", implies that it was already in existence and
    would not cease. Therefore it is logical to believe that before the Great Flood, winter and summer, cold and heat
    did exist. This affirmation clearly <strong>destroys the hypothesis of one same global climate and the so called
        blanket of clouds.</strong></p>
