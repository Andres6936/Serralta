    <title>Pharisees did not abey God's Law</title>
</head>
<body>
<strong>Pharisees were not faithfully obedient to God's Law as many brothers think now a day</strong>
<p> Pharisees are depicted by some brethren now a day as people who really tried hard to obey God's Law, and even as if
    they really were perfect in their deeds. These brethren even think that the <strong>only</strong> sin of the
    Pharisees was to reject Jesus. Even many of them think that if someone could be saved by their own works, by obeying
    God's Law, it was the Pharisees. <strong>It is not true.</strong> On the contrary, <strong>they feigned that they
        obeyed, but they really didn't.</strong> They were hypocritical in all they did. They did not obey God's
    behavior laws. <strong>The only laws they kept were the rites,</strong> because this was what gave them leverage
    with the religious elite. By keeping all the laws concerning rites, sacrificing of lambs, giving of tithes, etc.,
    which were economically convenient for the priests, they increased their political clout, their influence within the
    governing body. I will reproduce for you Matthew 23: 1-39 so that you can see for yourself who the Pharisees were.
    <strong>This is not my opinion, it is Jesus' opinion.</strong> As you read this passage, note that <strong>Jesus
        called them hypocrites seven times</strong>. In <strong>verse 3</strong>, he denounces that they say, but did
    not. <strong>In verse 4,</strong> Jesus says that they put heavy loads on men, but they themselves did not touch the
    loads. <strong>In verse 5</strong>, he declares that everything they did was to be seen of men. <strong>In verse
        13,</strong> Christ states that the Pharisees will not enter in heaven. <strong>In verses 17, 19 and 24</strong>,
    he says that they were fools and that they were blind. <strong>In 25</strong>, Jesus affirms that they were full of
    extortion and excess. <strong>In verse 28</strong>, he says that they were full of hypocrisy and iniquity. And,
    <strong>in verse 33</strong>, he asserts that they are a brood of vipers that will not avoid hell<strong>.</strong>
    Now, after reading Jesus' opinion about the Pharisees, would you think that they were people who really endeavored
    to fulfill God's commandments? Why then are there so many brothers who set the Pharisees as examples of people who
    had a great commitment to God's Law? Why don't they mention instead men like Job, Daniel, Samuel, Noah, Josiah, and
    the prophets? Let us now read a real description of what a Pharisee was.</p>
<p> "1 <i>Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,</i> 2 <i>saying: The</i> <i> scribes and the
    Pharisees sit in Moses' seat.</i> 3 <i>All therefore whatsoever they</i> <i> bid you observe, that observe and do;
    but do not ye after their works: <strong>for</strong></i> <strong> they say, and do not.</strong>4 <i>For they bind
    heavy burdens and grievous to be borne,</i> <i> and lay them on men's shoulders; <strong>but they themselves will
    not move them</strong></i> <strong> with one of their fingers.</strong> 5 <i>But <strong>all their works they do for
    to be seen of men:</strong></i> <i> they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their
    garments,</i> 6 <i>and love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,</i> 7 <i>and
    greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.</i> <i> </i> 8 <i>But be not ye called Rabbi, for
    one is your Master, even Christ; and all</i> <i> ye are brethren.</i> 9 <i>And call no man your father upon the
    earth: for one is your</i> <i> Father, which is in heaven.</i> 10 <i>Neither be ye called masters: for one is
    your</i> <i> Master, even Christ.</i> 11 <i>But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.</i> 12 <i>And
    whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble</i> <i> himself shall be exalted.</i>
    <i> </i> 13 <i>But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for <strong>ye shut up the</strong></i>
    <i><strong> kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves,</strong> neither suffer</i> <i> ye them
        that are entering to go in.</i> <i> </i> 14 <i>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for <strong>ye
        devour widows'</strong></i> <i><strong> houses,</strong> and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall
        receive the</i> <i> greater damnation.</i> <i> </i> 15 <i>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for
        ye compass sea and</i> <i> land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, <strong>ye make him twofold more
        the</strong></i> <strong> child of hell than yourselves.</strong> <i> </i> 16 <i>Woe unto you, ye <strong>blind
        guides</strong>, which say: Whosoever shall swear by the</i> <i> temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall
        swear by the gold of the temple, he is a</i> <i> debtor!</i> 17 <i>Ye fools and blind, for whether is greater,
        the gold, or the temple that</i> <i> sanctifieth the gold?</i> 18 <i>And: Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it
        is nothing;</i> <i> but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.</i> 19 <strong>Ye fools
        and</strong> <i><strong> blind,</strong> for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the
        gift?</i> <i> </i> 20 <i>Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things</i> <i>
        thereon.</i> 21 <i>And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that</i> <i> dwelleth
        therein.</i> 22 <i>And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne</i> <i> of God, and by him that
        sitteth thereon.</i> 23<i>Woe unto you, scribes and <strong>Pharisees, hypocrites</strong>! for <strong>ye pay
        tithe of mint</strong></i> <i><strong> and anise and cummin</strong>, and have omitted the weightier matters of
        the law,</i> <i> judgment, mercy, and faith. These ought ye to have done, and not to leave the</i> <i> other
        undone.</i> <i> 24 <strong>Ye blind guides</strong>, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel. 25 Woe
        unto</i> <i> you, <strong>scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites</strong>! for ye make clean the outside of the</i>
    <i> cup and of the platter, but within they are <strong>full of extortion and excess.</strong> 26 Thou</i> <i> blind
        Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the</i> <i> outside of them may be clean
        also.</i> <i> </i> 27 <i>Woe unto you, <strong>scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites</strong>! for ye are like unto</i>
    <i> whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full</i> <i> of dead men's bones, and
        of all uncleanness.</i> 28 <i>Even so ye also outwardly</i> <i> appear righteous unto men, but within <strong>ye
        are full of hypocrisy and iniquity</strong>.</i> 29 <i>Woe</i> <i> unto you, <strong>scribes and Pharisees,
        hypocrites</strong>! because ye build the tombs of the</i> <i> prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the
        righteous,</i> 30 <i>and say: If we had been</i> <i> in the days of our fathers, we would not have been
        partakers with them in the</i> <i> blood of the prophets.</i> 31 <i>Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves,
        that ye are</i> <i> the children of them which killed the prophets. 32 Fill ye up then the measure</i> <i> of
        your fathers.</i> <i> </i> 33 <strong>Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of
        hell?</strong> <i> </i> 34 <i>Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes, and</i>
    <i> some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your</i> <i> synagogues, and
        persecute them from city to city,</i> 35 <i>That upon you may come all</i> <i> the righteous blood shed upon the
        earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the</i> <i> blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew
        between the temple and the</i> <i> altar.</i> 36 <i>Verily I say unto you: All these things shall come upon this
        generation.</i> <i> </i> 37 <i>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them
        which</i> <i> are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as</i> <i> a hen
        gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!</i> 38 <i>Behold, your</i> <i> house is left unto you
        desolate.</i> 39 <i>For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth,</i> <i> till ye shall say, Blessed is he
        that cometh in the name of the Lord</i>."</p>
<p> As we have seen, the Pharisees did not obey the law, they only pretended they did. At the same time, they invented
    new laws and interpretations of laws, which were not authorized by God. They used to fabricate ludicrous doctrines
    to be imposed on men. These unauthorized doctrines are what many people today think the law was.</p>
<p> Those who believe that the Pharisees were great people, listen to the words of Christ.</p>
