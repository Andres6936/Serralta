<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:18.0pt'>Exaggeration of the commandment:</span></b> <br>
<b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>&quot;Judge not, that ye be not judged&quot;</span></b>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some Christians that exaggerate this advice of
the Lord to such an extent, that they think they cannot emit an opinion about
anything or anyone.&nbsp; They have hypertrophied and twisted this verse so
much that they refrain themselves from giving a report about the
characteristics, traits or behaviors of another person. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are others who, being immersed in their sins, do not
desire that any brother rebuke or advise them.&nbsp; They fend themselves off
by grabbing hold of this verse.&nbsp; I know a man who used to say:&nbsp; <b>&quot;Do
not, judge! Do not judge!&nbsp; Beware of the spiritual consequences of judging
others&quot;.&nbsp; </b>This was his way to coerce into silence any brother who
wanted to talk to him about his adulteries and fornications. </p>

<p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;<i>Judge
not, that ye be not judged. For with <b>what judgment ye judge, ye shall</b></i>
<br>
<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be judged:</i></b><i> and with
what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</i> <br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And why beholdest thou the mote
that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest</i> <br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not the beam that is in thine own
eye? Or how wilt thou say to thy brother: &quot;Let</i> <br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me pull out <b>the mote</b> out
of thine eye&quot;; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?</i> <br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou hypocrite, <b>first cast out
the beam out of thine own eye</b>; and then shalt thou</i> <br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; see clearly to cast out the mote
out of thy brother's eye</i>.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( Matt 7:1-5 ) </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What the Lord is saying here, to my understanding, is
that we should not point out small flaws in our brothers, while we are deeply
involved in bigger and deeper flaws ourselves. What the Lord means is <b>that
we must not judge unjustly</b>, nor give ourselves the right to say if an
illness or suffering is a punishment or simply an accident of life, neither if
a person is going to go to hell or going to be saved. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Based on the integral teaching of the Bible</b>, <b>I do <u>not</u>
believe</b> Our Lord is telling us that <b>we must not use our common sense and
discernment</b> to get an idea about the behavior and attitudes of other
people.&nbsp; Instead, I think that he is exhorting us not to unjustly apply
rules to other people, because what we do to others we could have done unto us.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the interpretation that can be drawn from phrases
like &quot;&#8230;<i>with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged</i> &quot;
and &quot;&#8230;<i>considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye</i>
&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we read a little further in verses 15-20 we see that J<b>esus
himself exhorts us to judge who is a false prophet.</b>&nbsp; If this is what
the Lord says after having said &quot;<i>Judge not, that ye be not judged</i>
&quot;, it is evident that he is not trying to paralyze our adequate
discernment. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;<b><i>Beware
of false prophets</i></b><i>, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but</i> <br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inwardly they are ravening
wolves.&nbsp; <b><u>Ye shall know them</u> by their fruits</b>.</i> <br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do men gather grapes of thorns,
or figs of thistles?&nbsp; Even so every <b>good tree</b></i> <br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bringeth forth <b>good fruit</b>;
but <b>a corrupt tree</b> bringeth forth evil fruit.&nbsp; A good</i> <br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tree cannot bring forth evil
fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good</i> <br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fruit.&nbsp; Every tree that
bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into</i> <br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the fire. Wherefore <b>by their
fruits ye shall know them</b></i>.&quot; ( Matt 7: 15-20 ) </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>It is evident that the Lord is telling us to try to
distinguish between who is a false prophet and who is not.</b>&nbsp; To get to
such a conclusion it is necessary for us to judge.&nbsp; <b>We have to judge</b>
who is <u>a good tree</u>; <b>we have to judge</b> who is <u>a bad tree</u>; <b>we
have to judge </b>what are <u>good fruits</u>.&nbsp; Therefore, it is not that
kind of judgment that the Lord is forbidding us. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should Matthew 7:1-5 be a total prohibition of judging
anything or anyone, <b>this would cause us to have a mental paralysis.</b>&nbsp;
If we see a bully beating a little old lady to death with a club, we could not
say that he is a scoundrel, because we would be judging this person. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>If this really was Jesus' command then, even the pastoral
institution could not exist, </b>because telling someone to believe in Christ
in order to be saved means that the pastor judged that he is not saved.&nbsp;
The job of a pastor implies to watch out for the souls, and tell them when they
are sinning; <b>and this action involves judging</b>.&nbsp; If the pastor and
deacons see a member doing something that is out of order, they could not dare
to tell him anything, because he would reply:&nbsp;<b> &quot;do not judge that
you be not judged&quot;</b>.&nbsp; Jesus did not put pastors in a position
where they would be constantly afraid of committing this farfetched&nbsp;
&quot;sin of judging&quot;.&nbsp; Also, when a Christian preaches the gospel to
a person, <b>this Christian must be &quot;judging&quot;, because he is thinking
that the person is not saved,</b> and therefore, he is committing the
bizarre&nbsp; &quot;sin of judging&quot;.&nbsp; <b>Jesus did not put Christians
on the verge of sinning by means of&nbsp; &quot;judging&quot;&nbsp; that a
person is not saved.</b>&nbsp; To think that is wrong.&nbsp; That
interpretation is ludicrous. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the first Christians did not have this attitude
of&nbsp; &quot;not judging any thing&quot;.&nbsp; We can see this in Acts 16:15
where <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lydia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
compelled Paul to judge her.&nbsp; Also, in I Co 2:15, where Paul himself says
that a spiritual man judges all things.&nbsp; Or, in I Co 5: 3, where Paul says
that he judges, and with a judgment of punishment.&nbsp; Again, in I Co 5:
12-13, where we can see how Christians judged other Christians.&nbsp; Or, in I
Co 6:1, where we see that saints did judge, and not only that, but in verse 4
it says that <b>it was <u>the duty</u> of Christians to judge</b> their
brethren. We see the same thing in I Co 10:15 and 11:13 where <b>Paul asked the
brethren to judge what he was saying</b>.&nbsp; And finally we have I Co 14:
29, where it is evident that the brethren should judge what the prophets say
during church services. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we can see, <b>our first brethren,</b> who were closer to
the teachings of Jesus and the apostles, <b>did not have that extremist
attitude of not judging</b>.&nbsp; Those who hold fast to this erroneous
interpretation have one of two reasons:&nbsp; <b>1)</b> They do not fully
understand this teaching of Jesus, or&nbsp; <b>2)</b> They do not want anybody
to rebuke them for their sins in or out of the church. </p>
