        <strong>Jesus never confronted problems of illegitimacy</strong>
        <p> Three flaws or mistakes were found in the December 20th 1998 Sunday School lesson. They are regarding the
            idea that
            <strong>a)</strong> Jesus confronted social problems (illegitimacy), because of his miraculous birth,
            <strong>b)</strong> Jesus couldn't be born in December and <strong>c)</strong> Virgin Mary was fourteen or
            fifteen
            years old when she married Joseph. The first two assertions are the product of the efforts of people who
            want to
            smear our Lord and his doctrines. <strong>Sadly, these errors permeate Christianity</strong>, causing good
            brothers
            to spread falsehoods. That is the case in the 1998-99 winter issue of the quarterly <strong>"Life and Work
                Pursuits".</strong> The third one is not that important, but it does not match with the picture that we
            get from
            the Bible, and therefore it is good to also talk about it. <strong>The first slander</strong> has been
            mentioned to
            me by several Jewish friends, who have learned it from their rabbis. These friends honestly believe that
            their
            rabbis are scholars who tell the truth, and so they sincerely believe the slander; though, they are
            sincerely
            mistaken. This issue will be addressed in this article. <strong>The second falsehood</strong> is that Jesus
            could
            not be born in December. This one is heard especially around Christmas. Jehovah's Witnesses are to be blamed
            for
            that. They cannot prove such a thing. The sad thing is that both falsehoods have slithered like a poisonous
            snake
            into the minds of many good brethren. This assertion is demonstrated a falsehood in Bible Note # 1 in this
            same
            website. <strong>The third mistake</strong> was created centuries ago by the Roman Church, which wanted to
            create
            their own goddess out of Virgin Mary. This mistake is addressed in Bible Note # 14 in this same website.
            <strong>I
                exhort any brother who disagrees with what I say here</strong>, to show me his point of view so as to
            enlighten
            me. It is important to get to the truth, because we will be held responsible for our words as it is said in
            Matt 12:
            36-37.</p>
        <p> "<i>But I say unto you, <strong>That every idle word that men shall speak, they</strong></i> <i><strong>
            shall give
            account thereof in the day of judgment.</strong> For by thy words thou</i> <i> shalt be justified, and by
            thy words
            thou shalt be condemned</i>." ( Matt 12: 36-37 )</p>
        <p><strong>Let's now discuss the false idea that Jesus was believed to be a bastard, an illegitimate
            child.</strong>
            Although we Christians know that he was not a bastard, the mere admission that he was believed to be a
            bastard is a
            cooperation to blasphemous rumors. So, it is necessary to bring forth solid arguments to take brethren's
            minds off
            such a polluted thought. To begin with <strong>there are no grounds in the whole Bible to say such a
                thing</strong>.
            It is just an invention that cannot be substantiated. It is just the effort of our spiritual enemies to
            lower
            Christ's public image. In page # 33 of the before mentioned quarterly, in lines 16-19 says:</p>
        <p> "Years later <strong>these suspicions may have been reflected</strong> in the Pharisees assertion, 'We are
            not
            illegitimate children', <strong>possibly implying that Jesus</strong> <strong> was illegitimate.</strong>
            Mary's
            courage and willingness to do God's will at any cost <strong>is admirable</strong>."</p>
        <p> The accolade <strong>"is admirable"</strong>, given by the author to Virgin Mary, is not to be appreciated
            after
            spreading the slander about her moral status in the society. It is like if someone says: "Pastor John Doe is
            suspected of stealing the church's money, but he delivers beautiful sermons". The praise "beautiful sermons"
            is not
            appreciated after spreading a falsehood against his integrity. <strong>Such a thing could be done by both, a
                naïve
                or a slanderer who does not want to be detected as such.</strong> <strong>The lame excuse used to built
                up such
                slander was that of John 8: 41,</strong> which in no way means that Jesus was considered a bastard.
            Let's take a
            look at the whole passage, <strong>no only at a little verse we are presented with</strong>, to demonstrate
            that it
            cannot be taken <strong>honestly</strong> as a base for such a "suspicion". <strong>First,</strong> if we
            read the
            whole chapter we can see that the Pharisees that were talking with Jesus in verse 41 were the same ones that
            were
            talking with him in verse 25. In John 8: 25 we see that t<strong>hose Pharisees that were talking to him in
                verse 41
                did not know who Jesus was.</strong> Therefore, how could they think that he was a bastard? How could
            they then
            "know" his "secret", and how could they use it against him if it was something that they did not know?</p>
        <p> "<i><strong>Then said they unto him, Who art thou?</strong> And Jesus saith unto them,</i> <i> Even the same
            that I
            said unto you from the beginning</i>". (John 8:25)</p>
        <p> If they did not know who he was, the phrase they answered, (registered in verse 41), could not imply that
            they
            thought that Jesus was a bastard. Second, if we keep reading that chapter we will see in verse 38 that
            <strong>Jesus
                accuses them</strong> of doing the deeds of their "father", referring to Satan. In verse 39 they,
            <strong>thinking
                that Jesus is in doubt of their ancestry,</strong> defended themselves saying that their father was
            Abraham.
            Then Jesus told them ( 39- 40 ) that they were not Abraham's children. <strong>That was an offensive
                assertion,</strong> because not being Abraham's descendant meant that they were illegitimate, that they
            were
            bastards. Jesus was saying such a thing in a spiritual sense, but they took it in a genealogical sense.
            <strong>Then,
                to defend themselves they said, "We are not illegitimate children"</strong> (as the quarterly says), or
            "We be
            not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God", as the Bible says. Let us read:</p>
        <p> "38 <i>I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which</i> <i> <strong>ye have seen with
            your
            father</strong>.</i> 39 <i>They answered and said unto him,</i> <i> <strong>Abraham is our father</strong>.
            Jesus
            saith unto them, <strong>If ye were Abraham's children,</strong></i> <i> ye would do the works of
            Abraham.</i> 40
            <i>But now ye seek to kill me, a man</i> <i> that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this
                did not
                Abraham.</i> <i> </i> 41 <i><strong>Ye do the deeds of your father</strong>. Then said they to him,
                <strong>We
                    be not born of</strong></i> <i><strong> fornication; we have one Father, even God.</strong></i> 42
            <i>Jesus said
                unto them, If God</i> <i> were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from
                God;</i> <i>
                neither came I of myself, but he sent me</i>." ( John 8: 38-42 )</p>
        <p> As we can see <strong>if we read the whole passage, the Pharisees were defending themselves. They were not
            accusing
            Jesus of being a bastard.</strong> They were saying that they were not bastards, because they were
            descendants of
            Abraham. Of course, Jesus was not denying their carnal ancestry, but their spiritual one. Therefore, the
            <strong>only</strong>
            argument ( John 8: 41 ) that is used to arise such a slander or such a doubt against our Lord, is baseless.
            We may
            say the same thing about what is written in page 34, second column, lines 5-7. It says: "We would
            <strong>admire</strong> Joseph <strong>for not being ashamed</strong> to take Mary as his wife. He and Mary
            knew the
            truth, but <strong>the neighbors would talk!"</strong> To say this, is to stab someone while faking that we
            are
            helping them. <strong>Joseph had nothing to be ashamed of, because no one knew that Jesus was not his
                son.</strong>
            Neighbors would not talk, because they didn't have the slightest hint that Jesus was not the son of Joseph.
            To say
            "We would admire Joseph for not being ashamed�.", is like giving a friend honey with poison. Joseph did not
            have
            anything to be ashamed of. Let us now see many facts that tell us that Jesus' acquaintances did
            <strong>not</strong>
            think of him as a bastard, but instead they thought that he was Joseph's son. <strong>1) Jesus was received
                in the
                synagogue.</strong> If we read Deuteronomy 23: 2 we will see that someone who was considered <strong>a
                bastard
                could not enter in the congregation</strong>. This commandment was so absolute that a descendant of a
            bastard
            could not enter even in the tenth generation.</p>
        <p> "<i><strong>A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD;</strong> even to</i> <i> his tenth
            generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the LORD</i>." (Deut 23: 2 )</p>
        <p> As we can see, <strong>it is evident</strong> that if Jesus were considered a bastard by his neighbors, he
            could
            have <strong>never</strong> entered in the congregation of the Lord. Nevertheless, he was always admitted in
            the
            synagogues, even in his home town, and even by his enemies. <strong>The Pharisees</strong> accused him many
            times of
            "violating" the Sabbath because he cured on the Sabbath, but <strong>they never accused him of being a
                bastard.</strong> That accusation was more than enough to destroy him; <strong>therefore it is more than
                evident
                that he was not considered a bastard.</strong> This argument alone should be enough to convince any
            <strong>honest</strong>
            one that neither Jesus nor Mary confronted such a "social problem"; but there are many other arguments.
            <strong>2)
                Mary was not stoned.</strong> In Deuteronomy 22: 23-24 is written that if a betrothed damsel lies with a
            man,
            she and he will be considered adulterers and must be stoned. It was not a matter of asking the husband to
            be, if he
            wanted them to be stoned or not. It was a matter that the whole town was going to take in their own hands.
            It was a
            mandatory death penalty. So, if Mary's neighbors did not stone her, was because <strong>when they saw her
                belly
                growing, they already attributed it to her husband. He took her as his wife before her belly could even
                be
                noticed, as we will see later.</strong> Stoning was a way of lynching, as it happened years later with
            Steve.
            Let's read in the Bible.</p>
        <p> "<i>If a damsel, that is a virgin, be betrothed unto an husband, and a man</i> <i> find her in the city, and
            lie
            with her; then <strong>ye shall bring</strong> them both out unto</i> <i> the gate of that city, <strong>and
            ye
            shall stone them</strong> with stones that they die. The</i> <i> damsel, because she cried not, being in the
            city;
            and the man, because he hath</i> <i> humbled his neighbour's wife: <strong>so thou shalt put away evil from
            among
            you</strong>.</i>" ( Deut 22: 23-24 )</p>
        <p> As we can see "ye shall bring" and "ye shall stone them", both refer to the people of the town. It was not a
            right
            of only the husband to be, but a duty of the whole town. So, reasonably the people of her town, when her
            belly
            started to grow, did not think that she was pregnant by anyone other than her husband Joseph. <strong>3)
                Joseph knew
                about her pregnancy right after it occurred, much before her belly was noticeable.</strong> It is
            obvious that
            <strong>if Joseph wanted to put her away secretly</strong> to avoid making her a <strong>public</strong>
            example
            (19), was because <strong>nobody knew</strong> anything yet. It is a nonsense to think that he was going to
            put her
            away secretly, if the people already knew that she was pregnant, because there was no secret in such a
            situation.
            <strong>Therefore, when Joseph was thinking about putting her away, it was yet a secret that she was
                pregnant.</strong> Joseph was not going to say anything, much less Mary. She knew the tough laws against
            adulteress. She was not going to be heralding that she was pregnant. It was shameful for her and for her
            beloved
            Joseph. Even Joseph did not want "to make her a public example". So it is more than logical that the only
            one to
            whom she gave the news, was to Joseph, (who did not believe her). <strong>In that very moment, when no one
                knew
                about her pregnancy</strong>, Joseph got a message from the Holy Spirit (20) by means of a dream.
            <strong>Immediately
                after the dream he woke up and received her as his wife</strong> (24). So, there was not the slightest
            possibility that anyone else knew the truth of her divine pregnancy. Everyone would reasonably think that
            she was
            pregnant from Joseph, <strong>because as soon as she was pregnant, before anyone could notice it, he took
                her as his
                wife. </strong> Let us read now Matthew 1: 18-25.</p>
        <p> "18 <i>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his</i> <i> mother Mary was espoused to
            Joseph,
            before they came together, she</i> <i> was found with child of the Holy Ghost. </i> 19 <i>Then Joseph her
            husband,</i> <i> being a just man, and <strong>not willing to make her a publick example,</strong> was</i>
            <i>
                minded to <strong>put her away privily</strong>. </i> 20 <strong>But while he thought on these
                things,</strong>
            <i><strong> behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him</strong> in a dream, saying,</i> <i> Joseph,
                thou son of
                David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for</i> <i> that which is conceived in her is of the
                Holy
                Ghost. </i> 21 <i>And she shall</i> <i> bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he
                shall
                save</i> <i> his people from their sins.</i> <i> </i> 22 <i>Now all this was done, that it might be
                fulfilled
                which was spoken</i> <i> of the Lord by the prophet, saying,</i> 23 <i>Behold, a virgin shall be with
                child,</i>
            <i> and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which</i> <i> being interpreted is,
                God with
                us.</i> <i> </i> 24 <strong>Then Joseph being raised from sleep</strong> <i>did as the angel of the Lord
                had</i>
            <i> bidden him, <strong>and took unto him his wife</strong>:</i> 25<i>And knew her not till she had</i> <i>
                brought
                forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS</i>." ( Matthew 1:18-25 )</p>
        <p><strong> Having rendered baseless the hypothesis that Jesus was considered a bastard</strong> by his
            acquaintances,
            let us demonstrate now that everyone who knew him considered him the son of Joseph. Of course, <strong>if he
                was
                considered the son of Joseph then he was not considered a bastard.</strong> <strong>The first argument
                is in
                Luke 3:23.</strong> There Luke asserts that the people thought he was Joseph's son. Luke tells us first,
            that
            Jesus' body was created by the Holy Spirit, but then also tells us that his neighbors and everyone else,
            thought he
            was Joseph's son. Whom are we going to believe: Luke or those who baselessly "deduce" that everybody,
            thought that
            he was a bastard?</p>
        <p> "<i>And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, <strong>being as was</strong></i> <i><strong>
            supposed,
            the son of Joseph,</strong> which was the son of Heli, which was the</i> <i> son of Matthat, which was the
            son of
            Levi, which was</i>�." (Lk 3: 23-24)</p>
        <p><strong>The second argument is in Matthew 13: 54-55.</strong> In that passage we see that Jesus was in his
            own town.
            When they saw his wisdom and works they were astonished that he were the same person they knew. So,
            wondering about
            these facts, they asked: "Is not this the carpenter's son?". <strong>Evidently they considered him Joseph's
                son.</strong> Besides, if they let him into the synagogue, it was because he was considered a regular
            citizen
            and not a bastard. Remember that bastards were precluded of belonging to the synagogue. Jesus not only
            attended the
            synagogue, but he taught there.</p>
        <p> "<i>And when he was come <strong>into his own country, he taught them in their</strong></i> <i><strong>
            synagogue,</strong> insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this</i> <i> man this wisdom,
            and
            these mighty works? <strong>Is not this the carpenter's son?</strong>,</i> <i> is not his mother called
            Mary? And
            his brethren, James, and Joses, and</i> <i> Simon, and Judas</i>?" ( Matt 13:54-55 )</p>
        <p><strong>The third argument is in Luke 4: 22.</strong> This passage demonstrates that <strong>in Nazareth,
            where he
            was brought up, he used to go to the synagogue.</strong> So, we see that he was admitted in the
            congregation, which
            means that he was not considered a bastard. Also we see that those people who were brought up with him, and
            the
            parents of those people, considered him the son of Joseph. <strong>Where is then the "suspicion" mentioned
                by the
                author of December 20, 1998 lesson?</strong></p>
        <p> "<i>16 And he came <strong>to Nazareth, where he had been brought up</strong>: and,</i> <i> <strong>as his
            custom
            was, he went into the synagogue</strong> on the Sabbath day, and</i> <i> stood up for to read. ���. 22 And
            all bare
            him witness, and wondered</i> <i> at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said,</i>
            <i>
                <strong>Is not this Joseph's son</strong></i><strong>?"</strong> ( Lk 4: 16 &amp; 22 )</p>
        <p><strong>The fourth argument is in John 1: 45.</strong> In this passage we see that when he was spoken about,
            <strong>he
                was referred to as the son of Joseph.</strong></p>
        <p> "<i>Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him,</i> <i> of whom Moses in the law, and
            the
            prophets, did write, <strong>Jesus of Nazareth,</strong></i> <strong><i> the son of Joseph</i>.</strong>" (
            John 1:
            45 )</p>
        <p><strong>The fifth argument is in John 6: 41- 42.</strong> In this passage again we see that <strong>even his
            enemies
            considered him the son of Joseph. </strong> Because they did not know the miraculous conception of Jesus'
            body in
            Mary's womb, they just knew him as the son of Mary's husband. If there was the <strong>slightest
                rumor</strong> of
            him not being the son of Joseph, his enemies would have for sure exaggerated it and magnified the rumor in
            order to
            destroy him as a prophet.</p>
        <p> "<i><strong>The Jews then murmured at him</strong>, because he said, I am the bread</i> <i> which came down
            from
            heaven. And they said, <strong>Is not this Jesus, the</strong></i> <strong> son of Joseph, whose father and
            mother
            we know?</strong> <i>How is it then that he</i> <i> saith, I came down from heaven</i>?" ( John 6: 41- 42 )
        </p>
        <p> As we can see, <strong>the only argument</strong> in which such a blasphemous thought was based on was
            rendered
            false. We have shown <strong>more than ten irrefutable arguments</strong> that demonstrate that neither
            Joseph, nor
            Mary nor Jesus had to face rumors of illegitimate birth. But sadly too many of our brethren want to learn
            rather
            from the enemies of Jesus, than from the Bible. These sad errors gets into the church literature because of
            a lack
            of inspection and supervision of both, the quarterly editor team, and the SBC. <a href="biblenotes.html">Back
