<p><strong>Not everything that a personage of the Bible says, is revelation, it is necessary to discern</strong></p>
<p><strong>The prophet Nathan told David something that was not a revelation, but a personal opinion</strong></p>
<p> It is necessary to take heed that not everything a personage in the Bible says should be taken as a revelation or
    divine teaching<strong>.</strong> It is necessary to apply common sense and above all<strong>,</strong> see if what
    that Biblical personage says at that moment is in concordance with the rest of the Bible<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> Not everything that the actual prophets say (if indeed there are) has to be the word of God<strong>.</strong> Not
    even everything the true prophets of ancient times said or advised was a divine message<strong>,</strong> as is seen
    in the case of Nathan<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> In verse 3<strong>,</strong> we see that Nathan advised David to follow the impulse of his heart and dedicate
    himself to construct the Temple of God<strong>.</strong> Anyone would have thought that this
    advice<strong>,</strong> coming from a prophet<strong>,</strong> was a divine confirmation of David's
    desires<strong>.</strong> However<strong>,</strong> we see further along in verses 12-13 how the same prophet Nathan<strong>,</strong>
    this time by way of a revelation from God<strong>,</strong> warns David that it is not he who will build the
    Temple<strong>,</strong> but his son who will reign in his place<strong>.</strong> <strong>Even though Nathan was
        sincere, he was sincerely wrong. The fact that a preacher or advisor is sincere does not guarantee
        anything.</strong> It only serves so that we know that he did not mean to harm us by what he has told us<strong>.</strong>

<p><strong>"</strong>1 <i>And it came to pass<strong>,</strong> when the king sat in his house<strong>,</strong> and the
    LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies<strong>;</strong></i> 2 <i>that the king said unto Nathan
    the prophet<strong>:</strong> See now<strong>,</strong> I dwell in an house of cedar<strong>,</strong> but the ark
    of God dwelleth within curtains<strong>.</strong></i> 3 <strong><i>And Nathan said to the king: Go, do all that is
    in thine heart; for the LORD is with thee</i>."</strong> (II Samuel 7<strong>:</strong>1-3)</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong>12 <i>And when thy days be fulfilled<strong>,</strong> and thou shalt sleep with thy
    fathers<strong>,</strong> I will set up thy seed after thee<strong>,</strong> which shall proceed out of thy
    bowels<strong>,</strong> and I will establish his kingdom<strong>.</strong> 13 <strong>He shall build an house for
        my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever</strong></i><strong>."</strong> (II Samuel
    7<strong>:</strong>12-13)</p>
<p> This warning is even clearer in I Chronicles 17<strong>:</strong>1-4<strong>,</strong> where we see that in verse
    2<strong>,</strong> Nathan tells David to do everything that is in his heart because God is with
    him<strong>,</strong> however<strong>,</strong> two verses later God tells Nathan the opposite<strong>,</strong>
    ordering him to tell David that <strong>he was not going to build the Temple.</strong> This is reaffirmed in I
    Chronicles 22<strong>:</strong>7-10<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong>1 <i>Now it came to pass<strong>,</strong> as David sat in his house<strong>,</strong> that David
    said to Nathan the prophet<strong>:</strong> Lo<strong>,</strong> I dwell in an house of cedars<strong>,</strong>
    but the ark of the covenant of the LORD remaineth under curtains<strong>.</strong></i> 2 <strong>Then Nathan said
    unto David: Do all that is in thine heart; for God is with thee.</strong> 3 <i>And it came to pass the same
    night<strong>, that</strong> <strong>the word of God came to Nathan, saying:</strong></i> 4 <strong><i>Go and tell
    David my servant, Thus saith the LORD: Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in</i>."</strong> (I Chronicles
    17<strong>:</strong>1-4)</p>
<p><strong>As we can see, what at first glance anyone would have taken as having come from God,</strong> because a
    prophet was saying it<strong>,</strong> was not a word nor advice from God<strong>,</strong> but the words and
    advice of a prophet that although he was a good man and under the influence of the Holy Spirit<strong>, his words
        should not be taken as coming from Heaven.</strong> When he advised David to follow the impulses of his
    heart<strong>,</strong> he was wrong<strong>.</strong> If that was so with prophets like Nathan<strong>,</strong>
    who <strong>evidently</strong> was a true prophet<strong>,</strong> how can we possibly believe with our eyes closed
    that everything that a pastor or someone who calls himself inspired says<strong>,</strong> has to be the word of God<strong>.</strong>
    No matter how sincere he may be<strong>,</strong> he could be sincerely mistaken<strong>.</strong> We have to know
    how to discern<strong>.</strong></p>
