<strong>Inorganic matter could have never evolved into a so called</strong>
<p><strong>"first simplest cell"</strong></p>
<p><strong>I advise that this article should be given to our young college group</strong> in an effort to help them
    avoid being misinformed by pseudo science. Our young adults environment was and will be bombarded with false
    information. It is important to prepare the college group in an effort to prevent a set back in their faith.
    <strong>There are only two alternatives to explain the existence of living beings:</strong> one is the theory of
    Creation and the other is the hypothesis of spontaneous generation. The hypothesis of evolution is just a new name
    given to the spontaneous generation after it was discredited and proved unscientific by Pasteur's experiments. Don't
    let anyone fool you by the new names. No matter if it is called evolution, mutation, or whatever, <strong>what does
        not belong to the theory of Creation, belongs to the hypothesis of spontaneous generation.</strong> <strong>The
        evolution hypothesis</strong> is based on the supposition that once upon a time the "first simplest cell" popped
    up from the sea and that the planet was a vast sphere of only inorganic products, until the so called <strong>"first
        simplest cell"</strong> appeared. After its appearance, according with the mentioned hypothesis, this cell
    started to live, procreate, and evolve towards more and more complex living entities. Of course, those who believe
    this hypothesis never bother themselves in explaining how the inorganic matter could organize itself into organic
    matter. <strong>To "explain" it they pass the bucket over to their god; they just put their faith in their god:
        "TIME".</strong> According to their faith, millions and millions of years can organize matter and do the same
    job that we Christians know God our Creator did. They do not explain how time can do the job; they just dogmatically
    affirm their god TIME can. <strong>According to the evolution hypothesis</strong> during millions of years water had
    only inorganic matters in its solution till one day, by some hocus-pocus act that cannot be explained nor proved,
    appeared the simplest living organism: the so called "first simplest cell". This cell was the first step in a huge
    evolution staircase of millions of steps, which led up to human beings. <strong>If complexity went a step down from
        this "first simplest cell", it would become just inorganic matter;</strong> but if complexity went one step up
    from inorganic matter it would become the "first simplest cell". According to evolutionists, this "first simplest
    cell" lived for a while feeding itself from the environment, and reproducing itself, so as to bring to existence
    other cells just as itself. As this process continued for millions of years, the Earth was populated by cells that
    evolved into more complex vegetation and animals. Can this hypothesis be substantiated, proved, or at least
    explained logically? Does it have no scientific or logical flaws? <strong>This is not a real scientific hypothesis
        because it has nothing to prove and there are several logical and scientific arguments to disprove it. It is
        just an act of faith by those who do not want to recognize that a Creator exists.</strong> Let us reason
    together using logics and our common sense, because this evolution hypothesis is out of all reason. The so called
    "first cell" also called the "simplest cell", could have never existed. Why not? Let's see first what the "simplest
    cell" had to have in order to perform the jobs assigned to it: to live, grow and reproduce. <strong>First. The
        "first simplest cell" had to have a membrane,</strong> otherwise it was just part of the environment. In order
    for the cell not to be part of the environment, there had to exist a separating factor or membrane. Until not very
    long ago the membrane was not well known. Today we have discovered so many functions in it that there is a whole
    subject of study about the membrane. Even a scientific publication named "Journal of Membrane" exist, because of the
    complexity of the membrane and a whole lot that is needs to be learned about it. So, the "first simplest cell" had
    to have a very complex membrane, that had to allow food to go through but not let the inside matter get out.
    <strong>Second.</strong> In order for the "first simplest cell" to keep living after popping up out of the
    environment, it had to have the possibility of taking inorganic matter from the environment, introduce it in its
    body, and process it so as to break it into less complex inorganic matter. This would have to be done in order to
    get the vital energy resulting from the breaking process, so that the cell could be alive. This process is what we
    call digestion, performed by the stomach, or better said, by the digesting apparatus. To break inorganic matter and
    get the energy resulting, is a complicated process that requires lots of knowledge about what chemical products will
    break other ones. It is not a simple thing. <strong>So, the so called "first simplest cell" had to have a very
        complex digesting apparatus.</strong> <strong>Third.</strong> Since this "first simplest cell" had to reproduce
    itself, <strong>it had to have a reproductive system.</strong> This reproductive system <strong>had to be skilled
        enough to know what would be the right time for reproduction,</strong> because the cell cannot reproduce unless
    it has enough matter for itself, so as not to die in donating its own matter to the other cell.
    <strong>Fourth.</strong> This "first simplest cell" had to have some ADN kind of thing, otherwise it wouldn't
    <strong>transmit to its descendants the necessary apparatuses to keep living, feeding and reproducing.</strong>
    Until some decades ago we did not know how complex the AND was. Now, that we have that knowledge we have to agree
    that any kind of chemical code that transmits characteristics from one cell to another is highly complex. <strong>This
        high complexity had to be present in the so called "first simplest cell".</strong> It is a nonsense to think
    that the so called first simplest cell could have ever existed. <strong>Fifth.</strong> Because the cell had inside
    itself other apparatuses apart from the stomach, and because those apparatuses need to be fed, then the so called
    "first simplest cell" needed a distribution system to carry the food from the stomach to other parts of the cell.
    This means that <strong>it had to have some sort of a simple distribution system.</strong> <strong>Sixth.</strong>
    The fact of having all these apparatuses brings forth another need. The "first simplest cell" <strong>had to have an
        apparatus to coordinate the works of the other ones.</strong> If not, an apparatus could be working or not
    working as it is necessary for the cell in order to live and reproduce. This means that the cell had to have a
    coordinating apparatus, sort of a central nervous system. As we can see <strong>this so called "first simplest cell"
        never could have been that simple, but instead highly complex,</strong> because in order to live and reproduce,
    it had to have many complex apparatuses. Each apparatus itself was complex enough as to not be deemed to pop up out
    of nothing. Much less can it be admissible to deem that all of them popped up together, in the same place, at the
    same time, joined together, coordinated themselves, and covered themselves with a working membrane to become a
    biological entity. As I said in the title of this article: <strong>Inorganic matter could never have evolved into a
        "first simplest cell".</strong></p>
