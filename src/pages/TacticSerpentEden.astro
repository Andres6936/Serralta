    <section>
        <p><strong>The tactics used by the serpent in Eden are the same today</strong></p>
        <p> I the Garden of Eden the serpent said that what God said could not be eaten<strong>,</strong>
            could<strong>,</strong> in fact<strong>,</strong> be eaten<strong>.</strong> Today<strong>,</strong> the
            same
            serpent says once again that what God says that cannot be eaten<strong>,</strong> can<strong>,</strong> in
            fact be
            eaten<strong>.</strong> This satanic tactics is the same because it brings him results<strong>,</strong> why
            change
            it<strong>?</strong> Today<strong>,</strong> the serpent whispers in the ears of many that Paul said that
            what God
            had commanded not to eat<strong>,</strong> in reality<strong>,</strong> can be eaten<strong>.</strong>
            <strong>History
                repeats itself, the technique does not change: why change something that brings in results?</strong></p>
        <p> It looks as if we were listening to devilish dialog<strong>,</strong> something like<strong>,</strong>
            <strong>"</strong>So God said<strong>,</strong> you cannot eat any meat<strong>?"</strong> And humans
            say<strong>,</strong> <strong>"</strong>We can eat of all clean animals<strong>,</strong> like
            cattle<strong>,</strong> fish with fins and scales<strong>,</strong> clean poultry<strong>,</strong>
            etc<strong>.;</strong> but animals and fish that are forbidden we cannot eat<strong>."</strong> So the
            serpent
            responds<strong>,</strong> <strong>"God knows that the day you eat the forbidden animals you are going to be
                under
                the grace and not under the law."</strong> And then<strong>,</strong> millions of Christians do what the
            serpent
            tells them<strong>,</strong> they eat the forbidden animals<strong>.</strong></p>
