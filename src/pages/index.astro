        title="R. L. Serralta Nogués - Daniel 7 How will we know when the return of Jesus Christ is about to occur?">
    <SectionOf>
        <Brief>
            <p>The author has the ability to impart his knowledge and experiences in a short and concise
                manner
                that is
                easy to understand. To put it in his own words let me share with you what he once told me:
                'I do not
                dissolve an aspirin in a barrel of water, so as to force whoever wants the benefits of the
                aspirin,
                to
                drink the whole barrel. I just give them the aspirin. That's why I write as brief as
                possible'.
            </p>

                    of the

                        the

                        book is
                        not about a writer trying to twist the Bible</strong> so that the
                    <strong>Scriptures</strong>
                    agree
                    with his interpretation of the prophecy. What the writer does is display before the readers'
                    eyes
                    what
                    the media has published, so that they can check for themselves the reliability of the
                    interpretation.

                    trust that

                    time invested in reading this book will yield more than a hundred times your investment. You
                    won't
                    have
                    to make yourself believe the interpretation; it will come to you just by reading . <strong>You
                        will
                        be
                        able to prove that we are in the third of the four last steps of human history before
                        the coming
                        of
                        Christ.</strong></p>
