<FONT size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A paleontologist decided to teach his students
a hands on class, in a field where he had partially dug up the skeleton of
a dinosaur. Many longhaired young fellows and some eager to learn girls were
paying riveted attention to the professor, as he explained the techniques
used at the site.</FONT>
<P style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0">
<FONT size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Suddenly one of the students raised
his voice and said: "Sir, this is not a real skeleton. This is a calcareous
formation due to the erosion suffered by this rock, along millions of
years."</B> Some of the students said: "Could it be? Maybe he is right!"</FONT>
<P style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0">
<FONT size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The professor, who could not hide his
indignation to what he classified as boldness, brashness and stupidity of
his student's statement, answered:&nbsp; "These bones, although not 100 %
well preserved, have many details and characteristics that absolutely preclude
the possibility of them having been formed by mere chance and erosion. Take
a look at this femur. Its epiphysis shows a perfect shaped surface to form
a joint with the next bone. Apophysis and other muscle attachment points,
tell you of the former existence of muscles. Nutrition channels prove that
there were veins and arteries. <B> All these details could not be formed
by simple erosion of a rock. It is too complex and well organized to be the
result of a mere chance and water erosion. To think this way is just
idiocy."</B></FONT>
<P style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0">
<FONT size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The student who cast doubts about whether
the bones were legitimate or not, asked for permission to answer and said:
"Sir, a couple of weeks ago you told us that not only the bones of dinosaurs,
but the entire body of these animals, were formed by chance through millions
and millions of years. <B> Today I brandish the same argument you taught
me before, and you reject it and classify it as sheer idiocy.</B> The entire
animal had more details and characteristics than these bones have, and is
much more complex than these dry bones, and you want me to believe that it
was formed by mere chance and luck. Bones alone could not be formed by chance,
but the entire animal could. I don't see logic or science in it, but
dogmatism."</FONT>
<P style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0">
<FONT size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem, said the professor, is that
you are a religious fanatic, who cannot understand science."</FONT>
<P style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; margin: 0">
<FONT size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No sir, answered the student, <B> I am
applying the very same arguments and reasoning that you used before to explain
the origin of these animals.</B> If these arguments are not scientific or
if they are redolent of idiocy, it is not my fault; I learned them in
paleontology class."</FONT>

<FONT size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that the same "reasoning" and
arguments that some people use for denying God's creation, are good for denying
their own hypothesis about the origin of life. In these cases we can apply
what Jesus Christ says:</FONT>
