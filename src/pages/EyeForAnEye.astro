    <title>An eye for an eye</title>
</head>
<body>
<p><strong>An "eye for an eye" was a guide for the judges, but the Pharisees distorted it</strong></p>
<p> Many who read the New Testament<strong>,</strong> when they read Matthew 5<strong>:</strong>38 assume from what is
    written there that at some point God said in the Old Testament that we should abhor our fellow beings and collect an
    <strong>"</strong>eye for an eye<strong>"</strong> in whatever they do to us<strong>.</strong> But
    <strong>"</strong>now<strong>"</strong> Christ disapproved what was said by God and amended the Father's
    words<strong>. Absurd!!</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong><i>Ye have <strong>heard that it hath been said:</strong> An eye for an eye<strong>,</strong> and a
    tooth for a tooth</i><strong>."</strong></p>
<p> (Matthew 5<strong>:</strong>38)</p>
<p><strong>The first thing we should notice is that Christ did not say "God said"; but that "it was said",</strong>
    without saying who said it<strong>.</strong> The commandment God established and used to guide the
    judges<strong>,</strong> was probably twisted by the people to justify their personal hatreds<strong>;</strong>
    converting it into a popular saying<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>God does not mandate such a thing in any place in the Old Testament.</strong> What is most similar to this is
    in Leviticus 24<strong>:</strong>15-20<strong>,</strong> Exodus 21<strong>:</strong>24 and Deuteronomy
    19<strong>:</strong>21<strong>.</strong> In these three passages<strong>,</strong> the judges are ordered that at
    the time of justice (not for their own conflicts)<strong>,</strong> they should use the standard of an eye for an
    eye<strong>,</strong> if there is no divine law in respect<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> If we read the first passage<strong>,</strong> beginning with verse 15<strong>,</strong> we will see that it is
    instructing them about the punishment they should impose for the diverse crimes<strong>:</strong>
    blasphemy<strong>,</strong> homicide<strong>,</strong> damages and <strong>injury.</strong> When it came to injuries
    is where<strong>,</strong> as a generalization<strong>,</strong> He tells them <strong>"...</strong>Breach for
    breach<strong>,</strong> eye for eye<strong>,...."</strong><strong>,</strong> and continues to do so to the end in
    verse 20<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong>15 <i>And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel<strong>,</strong> saying<strong>:</strong>
    Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin<strong>.</strong></i> 16 <i>And he that blasphemeth the name of the
    LORD<strong>,</strong> he shall surely be put to death<strong>,</strong> and all the congregation shall certainly
    stone him<strong>,</strong> as well the stranger<strong>,</strong> as he that is born in the land<strong>,</strong>
    when he blasphemeth the name of the LORD<strong>,</strong> shall be put to death<strong>.</strong></i> 17 <i>And he
    that killeth any man shall surely be put to death<strong>.</strong></i> 18 <i>And he that killeth a beast shall make
    it good<strong>;</strong> beast for beast<strong>.</strong></i> 19 <strong>And if a man cause a blemish in his
    neighbour, as he hath done, so shall it be done to him;</strong> 20 <strong><i>breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth
    for tooth; as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again</i>."</strong> (Lev
    24<strong>:</strong>15-20)</p>
<p> As we can see<strong>,</strong> what this is talking about is a rule for the judges to follow<strong>;</strong> but
    it seems that the Jews twisted this and began to justify themselves in their hatred by alleging this passage<strong>.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>The second passage</strong> that could have had an origin to that popular saying refers to what the judges
    needed to do<strong>.</strong> Let's see<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong>22 <i>If men strive<strong>,</strong> and hurt a woman with child<strong>,</strong> so that her
    fruit depart from her<strong>,</strong> and yet no mischief follow<strong>,</strong> he shall be surely
    punished<strong>,</strong> according as the woman's husband will lay upon him<strong>;</strong> and he shall pay as
    the judges determine<strong>.</strong></i> 23 <strong>And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for
    life,</strong> 24 <strong>eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,</strong> 25 <strong><i>burning
    for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe</i>."</strong> (Ex 21<strong>:</strong>22-25)</p>
<p> In the previous passage we once again see that the mandate of an <strong>"</strong>eye for an eye<strong>"</strong>
    was not given to the believers for them to use with respect to their personal hatred and quarrels<strong>,</strong>
    but so that the judges would have a guide to act upon<strong>.</strong> We see the same in the following passage of
    Deuteronomy 19<strong>:</strong>21<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong>16 <strong>If a false witness rise up</strong> <i>against any man to testify against him that which
    is wrong<strong>,</strong></i> 17 <i>then both the men<strong>,</strong> between whom the controversy
    is<strong>,</strong> shall stand before the LORD<strong>,</strong> before the priests and the
    judges<strong>,</strong> which shall be in those days<strong>.</strong></i> 18 <strong>And the judges shall make
    diligent inquisition,</strong> <i>and<strong>,</strong> behold<strong>,</strong> if the witness be a false
    witness<strong>,</strong> and hath testified falsely against his brother<strong>,</strong></i> 19 <strong>then shall
    ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother,</strong> <i>so shalt thou put the evil away from
    among you<strong>.</strong></i> 20 <i>And those which remain shall hear<strong>,</strong> and fear<strong>,</strong>
    and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you<strong>.</strong></i> 21 <strong><i>And thine eye shall
    not pity, but life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot</i>."</strong>
    (Deuteronomy 19<strong>:</strong>16-21)</p>
<p> As we have seen in all of these passages<strong>,</strong> every time <strong>"</strong>an eye for an
    eye<strong>"</strong> is mentioned<strong>,</strong> it is referring to the way a judge has to punish a
    criminal<strong>,</strong> it was not a norm used to stir up personal hatred<strong>.</strong> When a person had
    been wronged<strong>,</strong> he had the right to not accuse<strong>,</strong> and forgive if he so desired<strong>.</strong>
    But when that same person was a judge and someone brought the case to him<strong>,</strong> the judge had to act
    according to that which was established in this passage<strong>:</strong> <strong>an eye for an eye.</strong></p>
<p> We are not going to think that Christ abolished the judges<strong>,</strong> the courts and the police when he said
    the statement an eye for an eye that was said among the ancients ones should not be the rule of personal
    conduct<strong>;</strong> nothing further from the truth<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> If we only read the New Testament<strong>,</strong> we would think that <strong>"</strong>what was said to the
    ancient ones<strong>"</strong> was in reality a mandate of God for the behavior of believers<strong>.</strong>
    However<strong>,</strong> if we also read the Old Testament<strong>,</strong> we learn that this is the standard for
    the judges to do justice<strong>.</strong> <strong>We have to read the entire Bible as it is,</strong> if we
    don't<strong>,</strong> we will not know how to properly interpret Scripture<strong>.</strong> <strong>That is why
        there is so much nonsense presented as Christian doctrine.</strong></p>
