<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:18.0pt'>Let's see how Paul says that those who tasted the
heavenly gift and were partakers of the Holy Spirit, later went astray</span></b>
</p>

<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>This passage below (Heb 6:4-6) is
a clear declaration of the possibility of losing salvation on the part of the
believers. Let us analyze it. </p>

<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>Paul is unquestionably talking about those who &quot;were <u>once
enlightened</u>; <u>tasted the heavenly gift</u>, and <u>were partakers of the
Holy Spirit</u>&quot;.</b> We don't need to give it much thought to realize
that the person that satisfies those requirements is nothing less but a saved
person, a born-again person, a Christian. I don't see a way of twisting things
to make it seem that a person who has been enlightened, who has tasted the
heavenly gift, who <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>has been a partaker
of the Holy Spirit</b>, who has tasted the good word of God and the virtues of
the coming age, is not yet a Christian, has not yet been born again. </p>

<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Furthermore, by saying that they
&quot;<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>fell again</b>&quot; we can
clearly see that they had gone away from sin, by the grace of God, and they
fell into it <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u>again</u></b>. Well,
according to Paul, some of them went astray. In other words, they were once
saved, and now they are not. <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>It is to
say that they had to be renewed <u>again</u>, therefore they had been renewed
before</b>. Let's see. </p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.2in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.2in;
margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   
</span>&quot;<span style='font-size:8.0pt'>4</span> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>For it is impossible for <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>those who
were once</b> <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u>enlightened</u></b>,
and <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u>have tasted of the heavenly gift</u></b>,
and <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u>were made partakers of the Holy
Ghost</u></b>, </i><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>5</span> <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>and
have tasted the good word of God</b>, and <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u>the
powers of the world to come</u></b>, </i><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'>6</span> <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u>if
they shall fall away</u></b>, to renew them <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><u>again</u></b> unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the
Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame</i>.&quot; (Heb 6:4-6) </p>

<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Well, these whole Christians fell
away, as indicated in verse 6; and they shall not receive another opportunity,
for in order to do that, Jesus would have to be crucified once more, and that
is inadmissible. </p>

<p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>And, I dare add</b>, I am sure that
he who was saved on the first crucifixion, and fell again, once saved again
through a second crucifixion of Jesus, he would fall once more; for if he
didn't think much of the first crucifixion, which he believed to be the only
one, much less would he consider the second one, being sure there would be a
third, and even a fourth. Therefore, taking into account human behavior, it is
nothing but logical not to repeat the Lord's crucifixion, and he who falls away
from the faith must pay the consequences. </p>

<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>Some believers of this heresy, &quot;once saved always saved&quot;, in
order to get out of the bind</b> that this passage puts them in, claim that
here Paul doesn't say that the Christian can fall, but it is rather a
rhetorical question, in which he says that, &quot;even if someone were to fall
from grace, Christ would not be crucified again&quot;. </p>

<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>Well, first</b>, Paul is <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u>not</u></b>
asking a question, but making a statement. Neither did the Holy Spirit ask a
rhetorical question, but a categorical declaration. <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>Second,</b> if a Christian cannot fall, under any circumstances, if
that were absolute and totally impossible, it would be illogical for Paul to
talk about it. It would be useless to warn that there would not be a second
crucifixion, because it would not be needed, no one would ever fall.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It would be like <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>warning a pedestrian on the <u>paved</u> streets of his city, to be
careful <u>not to be bitten by a shark that is wandering the streets</u>.</b>
It is illogical to attribute such senseless words to an inspired man, like
Paul, warning of a danger that he very well knew, did not exist. </p>

<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Besides everything already said,
we know that <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Paul knew how to present
hypothetical examples he did not believe; and he did it as to not to leave room
for doubt that it was hypothetical.</b> Such hypothetical example we find in
Gal 4:15, where he says that, if possible, you would pluck out your eyes to
give to me. In other words, he knew how to use the hypothetical language
without leaving doubt that it was indeed hypothetical; and evidently, here in
Heb. 6:4-6 he is not using it. Therefore it is clear that Paul is not speaking
hypothetically but real; he is not asking a rhetorical question, but rather
making a statement, giving <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>a serious
warning</b>. </p>

<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>Who falls back?</b> The Lord God knows that the human being is weak,
and thus He has provided the opportunity to repent. No, repentance is not lip
service, it is heartfelt. When a Christian sins out of weakness, or a very
strong temptation, or trying to be holy without God's help, or out of
ignorance, or trying to face temptation without divine help, etc., and falls,
but is sorry that he did, and <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u>repents
truly</u></b>, such Christian has not to fear of losing his salvation. That is
precisely why Jesus died. This is proven by Peter's sin. But note his
repentance: <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>he wept bitterly</b>. </p>

<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Such is not the case of him who
sins and <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>does not weep bitterly</b>,
because he does not love the Lord and therefore is not sorry for the betrayal, <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>he is just using Jesus to be saved.</b> This
type of religious individual believed that Christ was his savior and his past
sins had been forgiven; but he does not hate sin, on the contrary, he loves sin
more than he loves Christ; that is why his sin draws him away from God, because
he loves his sin more than he loves the Lord. </p>

<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>Those who sin and are not sorry of having sinned, those who sin and
think they <u>have</u> to be forgiven, because we are under grace</b>, are the
same that little by little harden themselves. Their love for sin is such that
they feel no guilt. They walk all over Jesus, they hold in contempt the blood
of the covenant, <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u>by which he has been
made whole</u></b>, and despise the <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u>Spirit
of grace</u></b>. It is those of whom Paul talks about as having but a horrible
hope or judgment and fire. Make no mistake, brethren, the sacrifice of Jesus
Christ is holy and we cannot play with it the game of &quot;sin-and-go-repent,
but I sin again because I love it&quot;, and <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>you <u>have to</u> forgive me, because I believe with all my faith,
that once saved always saved&quot;</b>. </p>

<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>Now, no Christian should think that falling back</b> is about just any
sin. In I John 5:16 we see the apostle John mention prayers in favor of a
brother that has committed a &quot;<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>sin <u>not</u>
of death</b>&quot;. Any sin that, after it is committed, causes a deep pain in
the soul of a believer, is a forgivable sin. </p>

<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The Lord, conscious of the moral
and spiritual filth of the human soul, has provided a shock absorber between
our actual salvation and the abyss of eternal damnation. Not because we just
cross the limits of holiness we are immediately going to fall into the abyss.
However, if we fall too far away from the limit, and we get ourselves more and
more into the dark muffling zone, we may very well run into the abyss, before
we can see it and turn back, because our eyes are callused by the sin and we
can't see the abyss. </p>

<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>It is as if the path of holiness
in our lives were lined by a muffling zone on each side; and just ahead of that
muffling zone, on each side, is the sinuous lining of the horrendous and
treacherous abyss. <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u>If we go down the
right path that the Lord has set for us humans, we have no risk</u></b>.
However, if every now and then we go astray from the path, only to return
immediately, we have little risk. But if we make it a habit to walk down the
muffling zone, without never really going down the right path, we are almost
certain we will fall into the abyss of eternal damnation. </p>

<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>If I were to show what I'm saying
graphically, I would draw the figure that follows as a straight path, a
muffling zone on both sides and an abyss of eternal damnation a little further,
all seen from above: </p>

  <p><img src="StraightPathAndAbyss.jpg" width="668" height="463"> </p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Anyone who, like person
&quot;A&quot;, goes on the God instructed way, without wavering, is never in
danger. Others like person &quot;B&quot; who sometimes wavers, but repents and
turns back, is not at a lot of risk; only if the segments &quot;D&quot; or
&quot;E&quot; along the way meet up with points &quot;F&quot; or &quot;G&quot;
on the spiritual sphere, can he be lost forever. However, person &quot;C&quot;,
who has gotten used to walking on the cushion zone, sooner or later will fall
into the ravine: if he avoids it in &quot;H&quot; he will fall in
&quot;I&quot;. </p>
