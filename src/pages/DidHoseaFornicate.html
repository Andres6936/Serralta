<center><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+2>Hosea did not
commit fornication or adultery</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When God ordered
Hosea to marry a wife of whoredoms <b>God was not ordering him to commit
fornication with that woman</b>.&nbsp; What He was telling Hosea was to
take that kind of a woman as his legal wife, not that he must lay down
with her and use her as his wife.&nbsp; Simply, Hosea had to take her "officially"
and support her and her children, in order to have a good simile of Israel's
betrayal against God.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something that
helps to understand this, is the fact that in the very same verse that
God ordered Hosea to take a wife of whoredoms, He also ordered him to take
children of whoredoms.&nbsp; Hosea was to take the children coming from
the fornications of his then future wife.&nbsp; <b>Therefore, if those
children were the product of fornication, evidently they were not his biological
children.</b>&nbsp; They were his children by convention, because legally
he was that woman's husband.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is clearly
seen in Hos 2:4, where <b>Hosea declares that those children were not his.</b>&nbsp;
This is also seen clearly in Hos 2: 2 where <b>Hosea says that he is not
her husband</b>, which is a signal that he did not lay down with her; otherwise
he could not truthfully say that.&nbsp; <b>If Hosea would have had sexual
relations with this woman, he could not declare that Ammi and Ruhamah were
not his children</b>, as he so emphatically declares in 2: 4.&nbsp; The
only way that he could be sure that he was not <b>slandering</b> the woman,
calling her adulteress, was if he never laid down with her.&nbsp; Let us
read the passage.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"<i>Plead with your mother, plead: for <b>she is not my wife, neither am
I her husband.</b></i></font>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight and her adulteries
from</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
between her breasts, lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day
that she was</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her as a dry land, and slay
her with</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
thirst. And I will not have mercy upon her children, for <b>they be children
of</b></font></i>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
whoredoms</i></b>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Hos 2: 2- 4 )</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This interpretation
becomes apparent when we see that all those actions were done in order
to make a living simile, to imitate the way that the Israelites behaved
toward God.&nbsp; Therefore both, the Israelites in relation to God, and
Ruhamah and Ammi in relation to Hosea, had to be someone else's children.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If Hosea's children were not someone else's children the simile was not
correct; if Hosea was their biological father, the simile did not exist.&nbsp;
And of course, <b>if the prophet would had laid down with this woman, he
could not be sure whether or not the children were his.&nbsp;</b> It is
easy to conclude that the prophet did not have sexual relations with that
woman, but only a legal relationship: she posed as his wife, he posed as
her husband, and the children posed as his children.&nbsp; The very name
that God commands Hosea to give to the child according to Hos 1: 9, tells
us that he was not his son; that name was "Lo-Ammi", which means "not my
people".</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All this is more
clearly understandable in Hosea's second marriage ( Hos 3: 1-3 ).&nbsp;
In this case Hosea explains plainly to the woman how their relations were
going to be.&nbsp; This passage is clearer than the former one.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"<i>Then said the LORD unto me: 'Go yet, love a woman beloved of her</i></font>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
children of Israel; who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine'.&nbsp;
So</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley,</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and an half homer of barley. 3 And I said unto her: 'Thou shalt abide for
me</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
many days; <b>thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for
another</b></font></i>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
man, so will I also be for thee</i></b>' ."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Hos 3: 1-3 )</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We see in 3: 3
that in a second simile, Hosea specifies that he was not going to have
sexual intercourse with the woman.&nbsp; Hosea said: other man will not
lay with you, and in the same way I will not go unto you either.&nbsp;
It is just logical to think that if he did not lay with this second woman,
he did not lay with the first one either.&nbsp; It stands to reason that
the same procedure was followed formerly, even though it is not said specifically.&nbsp;
It is common in the Bible for a later passage to make clearer a former
one.&nbsp; This is the case with those two passages.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Hosea did
not fornicate in the first case, nor committed adultery in the second.</b>
It is not logical to think that God ordered a prophet to fornicate or to
commit adultery.&nbsp; <b>If God does not tempt anyone, according to James
1: 13, much less is He going <u>to order</u> anyone to commit a sin.</b></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"<i>Let no man say when he is tempted: 'I am tempted of God'; for God</i></font>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
cannot be tempted with evil, <b>neither tempteth He any man</b></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">."
( Ja 1:13 )</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To tempt" is
the action of putting in someone else's mind the idea to commit a sin.&nbsp;<b>
If it is not in the nature of God to put in somebody's mind the idea of
a sin, much less is He going to order anyone to commit that sin.</b>&nbsp;
Would anyone think that God would command a Christian to worship an image
of Buda or an image of the Devil?&nbsp; Would you think that God would
order a person to murder a little old lady, rob her and give the money
to the church?&nbsp; Would you think that God would command someone to
slander someone's wife saying that he saw her laying with somebody else?&nbsp;
If we would not believe these horrible things, why would we believe that
God commanded Hosea to commit such horrible sins as fornication first and
adultery later?</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>It is good
to explain this passage to our brethren so that they do not get a twisted
interpretation of it, and especially to avoid a twisted concept of God's
character.</b>&nbsp; God does not contradict Himself.&nbsp; If He gives
a commandment today, He is not going later to give another commandment
that is just the opposite of the former one.&nbsp; God is a God of harmony,
not of contradictions.&nbsp; If He thinks today that something is sinful,
He will not think tomorrow that it is not.&nbsp; Adultery and fornication
have been sinful since human flesh has been on Earth<b>.</b>&nbsp; According
to Numbers 5:31 and Deuteronomy 24: 1- 4 God specifically prohibits that
a man returns to his wife after she has been with another man.&nbsp; If
He considered such a behavior a sinful one, is not logical that He was
going to order Hosea to do the very same thing that He formerly forbade.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not let anyone
twist these passages to justify himself in his fornications and adulteries,
or to justify the making a cuckold of himself.</font>
