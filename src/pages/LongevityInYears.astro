<Layout title="Gn 5: 3-17 Human Longevity was given in years, not in months">
    <section>
        <strong>THE LONGEVITY OF OUR FIRST FATHERS WAS GIVEN IN YEARS, NOT IN MONTHS OR MOONS.</strong>
        <p> People exist who are try to deny the fact that our first fathers (Adam, Seth, etc.) used to live for
            centuries. They
            allege that the years mentioned in those chapters are really "months" or "moons". <strong>The only base for
                their
                absurd hypothesis is</strong> that if the number of years mentioned in the Bible for the antediluvian
            patriarchs
            ages is divided by 12, the result is a number of years <strong>"more acceptable" to them.</strong> As an
            example
            they show that if 930 years, the biblical age of Adam, is divided by 12 the quotient is 77 years. If
            Methuselah's
            age ( 969 ) is divided by 12 months the quotient is almost 81 years, and so on. <strong>When human beings
                want to
                deny God, or the authority of the Bible, they appeal to any nonsense, without using discernment, logic
                or
                scientific methods</strong>. Mankind made up this hypothesis and clothed it with the cloak of science.
            <strong>These
                "enlightened ones"</strong> who thought they found the "explanation" of the longevity of the patriarchs,
            didn't
            make any effort in reasoning even superficially the issue. That's why they charged against this passage
            wantonly and
            irresponsibly, thinking joyfully, that they have "discovered" a flaw in the Scriptures or in its
            interpretations.
            That is why they solemnly declare that in this passage the "so called" years, were just "moons" or "months".
            They
            declare all this without noticing that before their own eyes is the denial of their foolish hypothesis. Let
            us read
            Gen 5: 3-17.</p>
        <p> "3 <i>And <strong>Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son</strong> in his</i> <i> own
            likeness,
            after his image, and called his name Seth.</i> 4 <i>And the days of</i> <i> Adam after he had begotten Seth
            were
            eight hundred years; and he begat</i> <i> sons and daughters.</i> 5 <i>And <strong>all the days that Adam
            lived were
            nine hundred</strong></i> <i><strong> and thirty years</strong>; and he died.</i> <i> </i> 6 <i>And <strong>Seth
            lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos.</strong></i> 7 <i>And Seth</i> <i> lived after he begat
            Enos eight
            hundred and seven years, and begat sons and</i> <i> daughters.</i> 8 <i>And <strong>all the days of Seth
            were nine
            hundred and twelve years</strong>;</i> <i> and he died.</i> <i> </i> 9 <i>And <strong>Enos lived ninety
            years, and
            begat Cainan</strong>.</i> 10 <i>And Enos lived after he</i> <i> begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen
            years, and
            begat sons and daughters.</i> <i> </i> 11 <i>And <strong>all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five
            years</strong>. And he died.</i> <i> </i> 12 <i>And <strong>Cainan lived seventy years, and begat
            Mahalaleel</strong>.</i> 13 <i>And Cainan</i> <i> lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty
            years, and
            begat sons</i> <i> and daughters. 14 And <strong>all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and
            ten</strong></i>
            <i><strong> years;</strong> and he died.</i> <i> </i> 15 <i>And <strong>Mahalaleel lived sixty and five
                years, and
                begat Jared</strong>.</i> 16 <i>And</i> <i> Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and
                thirty
                years, and</i> <i> begat sons and daughters. </i> 17 <i>And <strong>all the days of Mahalaleel were
                eight</strong></i> <strong> hundred ninety and five years;</strong> <i>and he died</i>."</p>
        <p> Let's use a little math: 130 moons divided by 12 = 10.8 years; 105 moons divided by 12 = 8.75 years; 90
            moons
            divided by 12= 7.5 years; 70 moons divided by 12 = 5.8 years; and 65 moons divided by 12= 5.41 years. If
            what these
            "enlightened ones" say is true, then Adam, according to verse 3, had a son when he was almost eleven years
            old; Seth
            had his first born when he was less than nine (verse 6); Enos when he was less than eight (verse 9); Cainan
            when he
            was almost six years old, (verse 12); and <strong>Mahaleel had a son when he was just five and a half years
                old,</strong> according to verse 15. <strong>As we can see their hypothesis is absolutely illogical, and
                not
                scientific.</strong> It is evident that not everyone who claims to be a scientist or to use scientific
            methods,
            is saying the truth. True science and true religion have to coincide, because true science can only discover
            what
            God has created, and true religion can say only what God said. What some people forget is that when <strong>our
                first fathers were 500 years old, they were as strong as an actual 35 or 40 years old man.</strong>
            <strong>The
                saddest thing of all this is that "Christian leaders" exist who believe these nonsensical
                hypothesis.</strong>
            Sure enough, many years ago I was taken by surprise when my Sunday School teacher, <strong>who was a medical
                doctor</strong> said: "With the knowledge I have of the human body I can assure you that nobody can live
            that
            long". Immediately he went to the blackboard and started to divide the total age of each patriarch by
            twelve, to
            "demonstrate" that the "so called" years were really "months" or "moons". When I went to the blackboard and
            divided
            by twelve the age at which those patriarchs had their first son, the only argument that came to his mind was
            to say:
            "Well, in different eras they counted time in different ways". Then I replied: "We are talking about the
            same
            passage, the same verse, and even the same man, not of different eras". <strong>It is very common that the
                hypertrophic ego of many brothers preclude them from rectifying in private, much less in
                public.</strong> This
            man was a Christian, he was not trying to harm the faith. His problem was that he had stuffed his mind with
            lots of
            pseudo scientific hypothesis. Sadly with the authority he had by virtue of being a medical doctor and a
            Sunday
            School teacher, he was unwillingly harming the faith of his brethren, who knew he was a scientist and an
            honest man.
            Sure enough, <strong>he was honest, but was honestly wrong,</strong> and <strong>the teachings of those
                brothers who
                are honestly wrong, are the worst of all.</strong> <a href="biblenotes.html">Back to Bible Notes
