<p><strong>Christian and self control</strong></p>
<p><strong>All man kind needs to learn to control its character/temper.</strong> Many of us have character flaws and
    don't realize it<strong>.</strong> This is because we find our flaws normal because we have lived with them all our
    lives<strong>.</strong> Others<strong>,</strong> notice our faults and tell us<strong>.</strong>
    We<strong>,</strong> however<strong>,</strong> do not always accept the warnings and advise that others give
    us<strong>.</strong> Mostly because we do not believe that what people tell us is true<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is like convincing a fish that it is wet.</strong> Its whole life it has lived in the water and does not
    know what it means to be dry<strong>.</strong> It would be like trying to make that fish understand what dry wheat
    flour means<strong>.</strong> The fish has always been wet and does not understand if it were told otherwise<strong>.</strong>
    That is what happens when friends (and non-friends<strong>,</strong> even enemies alike) point out flaws in our
    character<strong>.</strong> Sometimes we don't understand them<strong>,</strong> because all of our lives we have
    lived with those flaws<strong>;</strong> we have been <strong>"</strong>wet<strong>"</strong> all our
    lives<strong>;</strong> we don't understand what being dry could mean<strong>.</strong>
    Nonetheless<strong>,</strong> it is worth paying attention and trying to see if what we are being told is
    true<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> King Solomon<strong>,</strong> who learned very much because of the wisdom that he was given<strong>,</strong> and
    the mistakes he made<strong>,</strong> exhorts us to control our character<strong>.</strong> Let's
    see<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong><i>He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty<strong>;</strong> and <strong>he that ruleth
    his spirit than he that taketh a city</strong></i><strong>."</strong> (Prv 16<strong>:</strong>32)</p>
<p> It is true that it is more difficult for man kind <strong>"</strong> to taketh<strong>"</strong> their own
    personality<strong>,</strong> by controlling it how it should be controlled<strong>,</strong> than to taketh a city
    with war<strong>.</strong> Haughtiness<strong>,</strong> lewdness<strong>,</strong> gluttony<strong>,</strong> hate
    etc<strong>.,</strong> are good proof of it<strong>:</strong> Man cannot control these things without God's
    help<strong>.</strong> There are thousands of kings that have taken cities<strong>,</strong> but few who have
    completely controlled their character<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> A city without walls is continually exposed to enemy attacks<strong>.</strong> Equally so<strong>,</strong> a person
    whose spirit has no harness<strong>,</strong> is easily victimized by temptations plotted by his spiritual
    enemies<strong>.</strong> That is why Solomon says the following<strong>:</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong><i>He that <strong>hath no rule over his own spirit</strong> is like <strong>a city that is broken
    down, and without walls</strong></i><strong>."</strong> (Prv 25<strong>:</strong>28)</p>
<p> One's character can be controlled<strong>.</strong> Once<strong>,</strong> many years ago<strong>,</strong> an
    acquaintance of mine succeeded fleeing a dictatorship that disallowed its citizens to depart the country
    freely<strong>.</strong> There<strong>,</strong> human rights do not exist<strong>.</strong> There<strong>,</strong>
    the police beats a citizen with a stick for any reason and the citizen has no recourse and is unable to go before a
    judge to defend himself<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> While said acquaintance was speaking in a group<strong>,</strong> (already living in the United
    States)<strong>,</strong> he boasted of how his character was so strong that he could not control his
    character<strong>.</strong> He would say that no one could shut him up and that he could smack anyone he wanted to
    smack<strong>.</strong> Upon hearing his proud comments<strong>,</strong> it occurred to me to ask
    him<strong>,</strong> if when he was in his country from where he fled<strong>,</strong> and the police mistreated
    him<strong>,</strong> did he dare to turn on them<strong>?</strong> He immediately responded without much thought
    <strong>"</strong>Are you crazy<strong>,</strong> over there the police will beat and kick you without limitations
    and then you go to prison without a court hearing<strong>."</strong> As we can see<strong>,</strong> the man with
    the <strong>"</strong>un-controllable character<strong>"</strong> knew when to control his
    character<strong>.</strong> Therefore<strong>,</strong> one's character can be controlled<strong>.</strong></p>
