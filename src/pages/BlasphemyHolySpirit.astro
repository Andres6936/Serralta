<p><strong>What was the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit</strong></p>
<p> There are many who don't understand what Jesus meant when he warned that blasphemy against the Holy Ghost was
    unforgivable. To understand this statement it is necessary for us to place ourselves in the same circumstances in
    which such statement was uttered, and to consider God's law against blasphemy. In Lev 24: 16 God orders that anyone
    who blasphemes be executed. It was to say that the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit was not the only unfogivable
    one, because the blaspheme against God the Father was not fogiven either.</p>
<p><i>"<strong>And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death</strong>, and all the
    congregation shall certainly stone him; as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, <strong>when he
        blasphemeth the name of the LORD, shall be put to death</strong>." </i> ( Lev 24: 16 )</p>
<p><strong>No Hebrew in all Israel, no matter how renegade he was, would dare to blaspheme God.</strong> Not even those
    who didn't believe in God would dare to blaspheme Him, because they knew that they would immediately have to pay the
    blasphemy with their life. Everyone who would hear them would stone them. Therefore, when Our Lord Jesus Christ said
    that all manner of blasphemy was going to be forgiven, he was not referring to those who would blaspheme God the
    Father, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, because such a blaspheme was uttered by none, it was something unthinkable.
    Nobody would dare to blaspheme Jehovah God, much less publicly, as these Pharisees blasphemed the Holy Ghost. Jesus
    was referring to blasphemies against himself.</p>
<p><i>"31 Wherefore I say unto you: <strong>All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men, but the
    blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. </strong> 32 <strong>And whosoever speaketh a word
    against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be
    forgiven him</strong>, neither in this world, neither in the world to come."</i> ( Mt 12: 31-32 )</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, disregarded the possibility that those Pharisees were blaspheming against God the Father, let's
    exam the possibility that the blaspheme was against the Divine Son of God.</strong> In Mtt 12: 32; Mk 3: 29 and Lk
    12: 10, Jesus says that any blaspheme that anyone utters against him would be forgiven. Since those people saw Jesus
    as just a man, like themselves, the fact that they would blaspheme him didn't have the severity of blaspheming God
    the Father. From their point of view Jesus was just a human being, that is why insults and blasphemes against him
    could be forgiven. This was product of their ignorance; they didn't believe that he was a Divine Being. It is more
    evident in Mt 12: 32 and Lk 12: 10, where Jesus talks about himself as "the Son of Man", consequently, those who saw
    him as just a man, didn't commit the unforgivable sin, when they blasphemed Jesus.</p>
<p> "<i>28 Verily I say unto you: All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they
    shall blaspheme, 29 but he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of
    eternal damnation. 30 <strong>Because they said: He hath an unclean spirit</strong>.</i>" ( Mk 3: 28-30 )</p>
<p> "<i>And whosoever shall speak a word against <strong>the Son of man</strong>, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him
    that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven</i>." ( Lk 12: 10 )</p>
<p><strong>Let's now look at all these passages, in order to figure out who the Pharisees were blaspheming
    against</strong>. According to Mk 3: 30, <strong>what Jesus considered a blasphemy was the fact that they said the
    Spirit that Jesus had, was an unclean spirit</strong>. Those people were talking of the Divine Being whose
    anointment allowed Jesus to make miracles. Their case was different from the previous one, because <strong>they had
        to be fully aware</strong> that the Spirit that allowed such miracles to be performed, <strong>had to be a
        Divine Being. Despite this evident conclusion they chose to blaspheme this Divine Being, calling him
        Beelzebub</strong>, as we see in Mt 12: 24; Mk 3: 22 and Lk 11: 15. They knew that no demon could cast out
    another demon. They knew that Satan could never open the eyes of a blind, resurrect a dead person, nor make whole
    those sick with palsy. <strong>That's why they couldn't be forgiven, because they knew to whom they were
        blaspheming, and they persisted in doing so.</strong></p>
<p> This was not the case of an ignorant or an atheist, who did not know the meaning of what they were uttering, or
    didn't know or didn't believe that such a divine being existed. <strong>This was the case of people who knew
        perfectly well whom they were blaspheming against, and even so, they wished to blaspheme him.</strong> They did
    so in order to get the "benefit" of casting doubts over the miracles performed by Jesus Christ, because they
    perceived him as their competitor in religion.</p>
<p> "<i>But when <strong>the Pharisees</strong> heard it, they said:</i> <strong><i>This fellow doth not cast out
    devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils</i>.</strong>" ( Mtt 12: 24 )</p>
<p> "<i>And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said: <strong>He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils
    casteth he out devils</strong></i>." ( Mk 3: 22 )</p>
<p> "<i>But some of them said: <strong>He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils</strong></i>." (
    Lk 11: 15 )</p>
<p><strong>That is why the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.</strong></p>
