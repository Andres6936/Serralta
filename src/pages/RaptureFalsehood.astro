    <title>Rapture Falsehood</title>

<body>
<p><strong>To believe or not in the "Rapture" before the Great Tribulation could become a matter of life or death, a
    matter of torture or liberty</strong></p>
<p> There is going to be an ingathering of the Christians during the Second Coming<strong>,</strong> but not a
    <strong>"</strong>rapture<strong>"</strong> before the Great Tribulation<strong>.</strong> The brethren that believe
    in a Rapture previous to the Great Tribulation should analyze very carefully this issue<strong>,</strong> because it
    can become <strong>a matter of life or death, of torture or liberty, for themselves and their family.</strong> It is
    like having upon them the blood of their family members<strong>,</strong> for the foolishness of not searching in
    detail<strong>,</strong> without the prejudice or emotion caused by a desire to believe in this imaginary
    Rapture<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If these brothers are preachers, then they have a double responsibility, because in addition to their own
    family, they will have the blood of those they deceive upon them,</strong> and for whose deception those unhappy
    ones would be tortured and murdered during the Great Tribulation<strong>.</strong> A most terrible weight on the
    conscience for those who preach the false doctrine of the Rapture<strong>!</strong></p>
<p> I warn you clearly about the falsehood of that heretical interpretation of <strong>"</strong>a Rapture before the
    Great Tribulation<strong>".</strong> I demonstrate in my book <strong>"</strong>Rapture Vs<strong>.</strong>
    Ingathering<strong>"</strong> that it is erroneous<strong>,</strong> and with this I am free of the blood of those
    that want to close their eyes to the truth<strong>.</strong> The apostle Paul warned the churches of the Gentiles
    Thessalonians very clearly<strong>,</strong> <strong>so that they would not allow themselves to be deceived</strong>
    with doctrines like that of the Rapture before the Great Tribulation<strong>.</strong> Hence he knew that someone
    would try to deceive the brethren towards the latter days<strong>.</strong> In essence<strong>,</strong> by warning
    them he warned us too<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong>1 <i>Now we beseech you<strong>,</strong> brethren<strong>,</strong> <strong>by the coming of our
    Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,</strong></i> 2 <i>that ye be not soon shaken in
    mind<strong>,</strong> or be troubled<strong>,</strong> neither by spirit<strong>,</strong> nor by
    word<strong>,</strong> nor by letter as from us<strong>,</strong> as that the day of Christ is at
    hand<strong>.</strong></i> 3 <i><strong>Let no man deceive you by any means; for that day shall not come, except
    there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;</strong></i> 4 <i>who
    opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God<strong>,</strong> or that is worshipped<strong>;</strong>
    so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God<strong>,</strong> shewing himself that he is
    God</i><strong>."</strong> (II Thes 2<strong>:</strong>1-4)</p>
<p><strong>It is very different the risk of those that believe in the Rapture before the Great Tribulation, and those
    that believe in the Ingathering during the Second Coming of Christ.</strong> If there were a Rapture before the
    Great Tribulation<strong>,</strong> what would happen to the Christians that do not believe in it<strong>?</strong>
    Nothing would happen to them<strong>;</strong> they would be raptured along with the other brothers that do believe
    in the Rapture<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> On the other hand<strong>,</strong> if the Rapture before the Great Tribulation is false<strong>,</strong> <strong>what
    would happen to those that do believe in this false Rapture?</strong> What would happen is that they would not be
    alert<strong>.</strong> But if they were alert<strong>,</strong> they would think that they would not need to do
    anything other than wait some more to be raptured<strong>.</strong> The terrible harm that this false doctrine of
    the Rapture will cause the brethren is that they will not leave their comforts and move to the <strong>"</strong>wilderness<strong>"</strong>
    where God has determined that they be taken care of<strong>.</strong> Instead they are going to stay waiting where
    they can be captured<strong>,</strong> always thinking that the Rapture is imminent<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Would someone that stands to lose millions of dollars correct their error?</strong> Would a corporation that
    prints and sells books advocating the false Rapture be sufficiently honest as to allow themselves to be convinced of
    the falsehood of this doctrine and of the terrible harm it causes<strong>?</strong> Would a corporation that sells
    videos that attractively present the alleged benefits of this false Rapture<strong>,</strong> be sufficiently honest
    to the point of allowing themselves to be convinced that these are falsehoods and of the harm caused by what they
    are selling and preaching<strong>?</strong> <strong>Would they throw in the trash bin tens of millions of
        dollars</strong> that they have invested in this heretical material<strong>,</strong> for the love of their
    brethren<strong>?</strong> <strong>Yes they can, but they would have to love God more than Mammon.</strong> Would
    they have sufficient mental honesty to discuss publicly this issue<strong>?</strong> Yes they can<strong>,</strong>
    but they would have to love God more than their egos and their pockets<strong>.</strong> Would they do
    it<strong>?</strong> <strong>Only time will provide an answer.</strong></p>
