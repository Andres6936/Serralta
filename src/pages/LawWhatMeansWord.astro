<p><strong>What do we understand in the Bible by the word "law"?</strong></p>
<p> In biblical conversations the word <strong>"</strong>law<strong>"</strong> is referred to as God's
    laws<strong>.</strong> Let's remember that Moses did not originate the Law<strong>,</strong> neither did Noah or any
    of the prophets<strong>,</strong> but God personally<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In the Bible there are two main groups of laws. There are ritual laws, and behavior laws.</strong> The ritual
    laws<strong>,</strong> as indicated by their name<strong>,</strong> referred to the rituals<strong>.</strong> It
    referred to the sacrifices<strong>,</strong> and the ceremonies that served as a prefigure to several events<strong>:</strong>
    Jesus' mission<strong>,</strong> when He came to die for us<strong>,</strong> also they referred to the coming of
    the Holy Spirit<strong>,</strong> the Second Coming<strong>,</strong> etc<strong>..</strong> The main ritual laws
    were those that referred to the Temple<strong>,</strong> and the sacrifices that would take place
    there<strong>.</strong> Other ritual laws included circumcision<strong>,</strong> the washing of the body so not to
    contaminate the Earthly sanctuary<strong>,</strong> which was a simile of the heavenly sanctuary<strong>,</strong>
    the presentation of the human first born<strong>,</strong> the sacrifice of the animal first born<strong>,</strong>
    etc<strong>..</strong></p>
<p><strong>Behavioral laws</strong> are those that God established for human beings to know how they were to behave
    towards God and their neighbor<strong>.</strong> Examples of these are the Ten Commandments<strong>,</strong> the
    laws that teach us how to act with foreigners<strong>,</strong> with our enemies<strong>,</strong> with the widows
    and the orphans<strong>,</strong> with the poor<strong>,</strong> with those things others have lost and we
    find<strong>,</strong> what if we injure others without intention<strong>,</strong> or out of
    irresponsibility<strong>,</strong> etc<strong>..</strong></p>
<p><strong>What does it mean to "be under the Law"?</strong></p>
<p> The phrase<strong>,</strong> <strong>"</strong>being under the Law<strong>"</strong> is one of those that act as a
    wild card<strong>.</strong> Most of the time nobody defines them<strong>,</strong> they only pronounce
    them<strong>.</strong> It is regularly applied to those persons that consider that the sins that in the Old
    Testament were described as forbidden are also forbidden for Christians<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> However<strong>,</strong> in the Bible<strong>,</strong> <strong>"</strong>not being under Law<strong>"</strong>
    generally means that <strong>to be saved we don't have to comply with circumcision, lamb sacrifices or other
        rituals.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But there are Christians who erroneously</strong> believe that this phrase means that Christians don't have
    to obey God's commandments<strong>.</strong> Is that true<strong>?</strong> Does that mean that all of us are not
    under the behavior laws that God established<strong>?</strong> <strong>Does that mean that we can now lie, worship
        images, commit adultery, steal, kill, consult the dead, etc.?</strong> Of course not<strong>!</strong>
    Then<strong>,</strong> why do they say we are not under the Law<strong>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>If by saying that we are not under the Law, they refer to not being under the ritual law, that is
    correct.</strong> In other words<strong>,</strong> if it means that to be saved we don't have to be
    circumcised<strong>,</strong> or sacrifice animals<strong>,</strong> or any of the sort<strong>,</strong> then the
    phrase is correctly used<strong>.</strong> But if they give it the meaning that we can do all kind of sin without
    being accountable for it<strong>,</strong> then it is a terrible lie<strong>,</strong> a horrible and satanic heresy<strong>.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>What does "not being under the Law" mean?</strong></p>
<p> It is very common in conversations between brothers as they talk about God's laws<strong>,</strong> to hear some say
    <strong>"</strong>we are not under the Law<strong>".</strong> That depends which laws he is talking
    about<strong>,</strong> as I mentioned earlier<strong>.</strong> If he is talking about rituals<strong>,</strong> he
    is right<strong>.</strong> If he is talking about behavioral laws<strong>,</strong> he is dreadfully
    mistaken<strong>.</strong> <strong>Having accepted Christ is not a "letter of marque" to do as we wish and continue
        thinking we are saved.</strong> (Letter of marque was a government license for practicing piracy against enemy
    ships)</p>
<p> I personally know a sad case about a man who claims that because we are not under the Law<strong>,</strong> a
    Christian can sleep with somebody else's wife<strong>,</strong> be a homosexual<strong>,</strong>
    swindle<strong>,</strong> etc<strong>.,</strong> and continue being saved<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> He considers that once a person comes to Christ<strong>,</strong> <strong>he cannot sin,</strong> but not because he
    avoids sin with divine help<strong>,</strong> but according to him<strong>,</strong> when a non-Christian sleeps
    with his neighbor's wife<strong>,</strong> he commits adultery and because or this sin goes to
    Hell<strong>,</strong> but when a Christian sleeps with his neighbor's wife<strong>,</strong> it is not
    adultery<strong>,</strong> because he is not under the Law as is the non-Christian<strong>.</strong>
    Dreadful<strong>!!</strong> Disgusting<strong>!!</strong> Satanic<strong>!!</strong></p>
