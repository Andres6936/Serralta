<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Halleluiah
what a miracle!!</span></b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now a days there are, ( and have always been ),
&quot;Christian&quot; teachers, who try to cast doubts regarding the miracles
and doctrines described in the Bible. They try to put down those who faithfully
believe all of what the Bible says. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long ago I was told an anecdote that, according to the
one who told me this story, happened in a &quot;Christian&quot; seminary.
Whether it really happened as I was told, or not, I cannot attest. But anyway,
the incident is very instructive, and is worth telling, because Satan's best
move is putting his own agents into Christian seminaries, and
&quot;modern&quot; versions of the Bible, which they twist little by little
along decades. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was one of those regular class days in the seminary,
and the &quot;Christian&quot; professor was going to teach about the passage of
the Red Sea and the people of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
There was a student who belonged to a charismatic denomination and was very
outgoing and candid. Since the moment that he sat in the classroom he started
to talk with everybody about the great miracle they were going to study this
day. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's read a summary of the passage that they were going
to study, to get an idea of what they were talking about that day. </p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.2in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.2in;
margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;<i><span
style='font-size:7.5pt'>22</span> And the children of <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region> went
into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground; and <b>the waters were a wall
unto them on their right hand, and on their left</b>. </i><i><span
style='font-size:7.5pt'>23</span> And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after
them to the midst of the sea, even <b>all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and
his horsemen</b>&#8230;&#8230;</i><i><span style='font-size:7.5pt'>26</span> And
the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, <b>that the
waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and <u>upon
their horsemen</u>.</b> </i><i><span style='font-size:7.5pt'>27</span> And
Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his
strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the
LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. </i><i><span
style='font-size:7.5pt'>28 </span>And the waters returned, and <b>covered the <u>chariots</u>,
and the <u>horsemen</u>, and all <u>the host of Pharaoh</u></b> that came into
the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them</i>.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Ex 14: 22-28 abbreviated ) </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the professor entered the classroom, the young
fellow was still thrilled about the theme of the day, and said in a loud voice,
almost shouting: Halleluiah, what a great miracle God performed!! </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The professor, showing little sympathy for the student's
enthusiasm, told him: Calm down sir, after you listen to my lecture, you will
see that there was not such a great miracle, as you think. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the professor started his class, telling the
students that the section of the Red Sea which the people of Israel had
crossed, was called the Sea of Reeds, because it was very shallow, <b>no more
than 12 inches deep</b>. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The professor had hardly &quot;explained&quot; the
crossing of the <st1:place w:st="on">Red Sea</st1:place>, when the outgoing
student started yelling at the top of his voice: &quot;Halleluiah, halleluiah,
what a great miracle was performed!!&quot;&nbsp; Obviously upset, the professor
called the attention of his student saying: &quot;Didn't you listen to what I
have explained? There was no miracle at all.&quot; </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the student replied: &quot;<b>Oh yes, sir, the great
miracle was that all the horses of Pharaoh's army were drowned in just 12
inches of water, along with all the horsemen</b>.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
