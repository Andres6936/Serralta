    <title>Halleluiah What a Miracle</title>
</head>
<body>
<p><strong>Halleluiah what a miracle!!</strong></p>
<p> Now a days there are, ( and have always been ), "Christian" teachers, who try to cast doubts regarding the miracles
    and doctrines described in the Bible. They try to put down those who faithfully believe all of what the Bible
    says.</p>
<p> Long ago I was told an anecdote that, according to the one who told me this story, happened in a "Christian"
    seminary. Whether it really happened as I was told, or not, I cannot attest. But anyway, the incident is very
    instructive, and is worth telling, because Satan's best move is putting his own agents into Christian seminaries,
    and "modern" versions of the Bible, which they twist little by little along decades.</p>
<p> It was one of those regular class days in the seminary, and the "Christian" professor was going to teach about the
    passage of the Red Sea and the people of Israel. There was a student who belonged to a charismatic denomination and
    was very outgoing and candid. Since the moment that he sat in the classroom he started to talk with everybody about
    the great miracle they were going to study this day.</p>
<p> Let's read a summary of the passage that they were going to study, to get an idea of what they were talking about
    that day.</p>
<p> "<i>22 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground; and <strong>the waters were a
    wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left</strong>.</i> <i>23 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in
    after them to the midst of the sea, even <strong>all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen</strong>……</i><i>26
    And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, <strong>that the waters may come again upon the
        Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.</strong></i> <i>27 And Moses stretched forth his hand
    over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and
    the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.</i> <i>28 And the waters returned, and <strong>covered the
    chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh</strong> that came into the sea after them; there remained
    not so much as one of them</i>." ( Ex 14: 22-28 abbreviated )</p>
<p> When the professor entered the classroom, the young fellow was still thrilled about the theme of the day, and said
    in a loud voice, almost shouting: Halleluiah, what a great miracle God performed!!</p>
<p> The professor, showing little sympathy for the student's enthusiasm, told him: Calm down sir, after you listen to my
    lecture, you will see that there was not such a great miracle, as you think.</p>
<p> Then the professor started his class, telling the students that the section of the Red Sea which the people of
    Israel had crossed, was called the Sea of Reeds, because it was very shallow, <strong>no more than 12 inches
        deep</strong>.</p>
<p> The professor had hardly "explained" the crossing of the Red Sea, when the outgoing student started yelling at the
    top of his voice: "Halleluiah, halleluiah, what a great miracle was performed!!" Obviously upset, the professor
    called the attention of his student saying: "Didn't you listen to what I have explained? There was no miracle at
    all."</p>
<p> Then the student replied: "<strong>Oh yes, sir, the great miracle was that all the horses of Pharaoh's army were
    drowned in just 12 inches of water, along with all the horsemen</strong>." </p>
