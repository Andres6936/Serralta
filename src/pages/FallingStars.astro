<p><strong>Will Stars fall? Are they not larger than the Earth?</strong></p>
<p> There are many who reject the idea that the Biblical prophecies that announce the fall of stars on Earth, could
    occur. They deem it impossible because of their narrow-minded approach that stars are much bigger than Earth,
    therefore a rain of stars will be impossible.</p>
<p> It is clear that the purpose of stars falling on the Earth is to give a clear and matchless sign of the Coming of
    the Lord, not to introduce a new astronomical theory. "<i>Immediately after the tribulation of those days, shall the
        sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and <strong>the stars shall fall from heaven</strong>,
        and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken</i>." ( Mtt 24:29 )</p>
<p> Even though stars are very big, the common person sees them as small. They will not be able to tell the difference
    between a meteorite and a real star. If several thousands of meteorites the size of an egg, a fist, or a coconut
    would fall on our planet, for the common person it is as if the stars had fallen or at least a great quantity of
    them. Nevertheless, the physical impact on our planet will be just as if thousands of small stones would have fallen
    on the Earth. <strong>Nothing, however, capable of destroying the planet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The warnings in the Bible are directed to the common person, not only for astronomers.</strong> It is
    fulfilling a prophecy for all mankind. When the sun and the moon darkens, the falling of the stars will indicate to
    mankind that the era of their haughtiness is over, and that we are in the threshold of the Eternal Kingdom of God.
</p>
<p> When the prophecy arrives, the common person and skeptics alike will be clear that it isn't an ordinary eclipse or
    meteor shower. A fearful rain of meteorites will achieve the goal for what it was prophesied: it is to warn mankind
    the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p> It is my opinion that the falling of the stars will be a great meteor shower. I believe so because of what is
    written in Rev 8:12. There it says that when the fourth angel blows the trumpet, there are still stars in the
    firmament.</p>
<p> In short, the purpose of the falling stars is to make mankind aware that a prophetical sign has been fulfilled.
    Therefore only what is enough for that purpose will occur.</p>
