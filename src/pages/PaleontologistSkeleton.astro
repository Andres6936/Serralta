        <p><strong>The paleontologist and the skeleton</strong></p>
        <p> A paleontologist decided to teach his students a hands on class, in a field where he had partially dug up
            the
            skeleton of a dinosaur. Many longhaired young fellows and some eager to learn girls were paying riveted
            attention to
            the professor, as he explained the techniques used at the site.</p>
        <p><strong>Suddenly one of the students raised his voice and said: "Sir, this is not a real skeleton. This is a
            calcareous formation due to the erosion suffered by this rock, along millions of years."</strong> Some of
            the
            students said: "Could it be? Maybe he is right!"</p>
        <p> The professor, who could not hide his indignation to what he classified as boldness, brashness and stupidity
            of his
            student's statement, answered: "These bones, although not 100 % well preserved, have many details and
            characteristics that absolutely preclude the possibility of them having been formed by mere chance and
            erosion. Take
            a look at this femur. Its epiphysis shows a perfect shaped surface to form a joint with the next bone.
            Apophysis and
            other muscle attachment points, tell you of the former existence of muscles. Nutrition channels prove that
            there
            were veins and arteries. <strong>All these details could not be formed by simple erosion of a rock. It is
                too
                complex and well organized to be the result of a mere chance and water erosion. To think this way is
                just
                idiocy."</strong></p>
        <p> The student who cast doubts about whether the bones were legitimate or not, asked for permission to answer
            and said:
            "Sir, a couple of weeks ago you told us that not only the bones of dinosaurs, but the entire body of these
            animals,
            were formed by chance through millions and millions of years. <strong>Today I brandish the same argument you
                taught
                me before, and you reject it and classify it as sheer idiocy.</strong> The entire animal had more
            details and
            characteristics than these bones have, and is much more complex than these dry bones, and you want me to
            believe
            that it was formed by mere chance and luck. Bones alone could not be formed by chance, but the entire animal
            could.
            I don't see logic or science in it, but dogmatism."</p>
        <p> "The problem, said the professor, is that you are a religious fanatic, who cannot understand science."</p>
        <p> "No sir, answered the student, <strong>I am applying the very same arguments and reasoning that you used
            before to
            explain the origin of these animals.</strong> If these arguments are not scientific or if they are redolent
            of
            idiocy, it is not my fault; I learned them in paleontology class."</p>
        <p></p>
        <p> It is true that the same "reasoning" and arguments that some people use for denying God's creation, are good
            for
            denying their own hypothesis about the origin of life. In these cases we can apply what Jesus Christ
            says:</p>
        <p>"<i>For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words</i></p>
        <p><i>thou shalt be condemned</i>." ( Mt 12: 37 )</p>
