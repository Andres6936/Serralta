<p><strong>Was Virgin Mary a teenager?</strong></p>
<p> I have heard only two bases to sustain the idea that Virgin Mary was a fourteen or fifteen year old girl when she
    received the news from the angel, and about sixteen when she gave birth to Jesus. The first argument is based on the
    wrong idea that in the Jewish culture, girls were given to marriage, as soon as they turned 13 year old. The second
    argument is based on the Catholic myth that Joseph was an 80 or 90 year old man, and Mary just a girl who continued
    to be virgin even after the birth of Jesus. Both of these arguments are wrong. But sadly, this error appeared in the
    1998-99 winter issue of the quarterly "Life and Work Pursuits". Is it true that in their culture, Jewish girls were
    married when they were teenagers? <strong>No, it is not true.</strong> I think that <strong>some people confuse the
        far eastern culture of China and India, with the biblical culture of Israel and Judah.</strong> It is true that
    in India girls get married even at 13 and 14. It happens also in Africa and some other countries, but it was not the
    case with Israel in biblical times. <strong>It is not true either that the parents made the wedding arrangements
        when the children were four or five years old. You will not find the slightest hint of such a custom in the
        whole Bible. This happened in India, not in Israel. </strong> On the contrary, you will find in the Bible many
    passages in which you will realize that those ladies that still were single were well over 20 years old. Let us see
    some of them. <strong>A man had to be twenty years old to be considered of age.</strong> When we read the Bible we
    notice that a male was not considered a man until he was twenty years old. He didn't enter in the count of the
    people (census), he was not considered an adult, until he was twenty ( Ex 30:14; 38:26 ). God did not consider
    accountable anyone who was under twenty ( Nm 32:11). That is why those teenagers were not called to war until they
    were twenty, Nm 1:3 & 20. If all this was true with a man, <strong>much less was a teenage girl going to be
        considered an adult in that culture.</strong></p>
<p> "<i>Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, <strong>from twenty years</strong></i> <strong> old and
    above,</strong> <i>shall give an offering unto the LORD</i>." ( Ex 30: 14 )</p>
<p> "<i>A bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the</i> <i> sanctuary, for every one that
    went to be numbered, <strong>from twenty years old and</strong></i> <strong> upward,</strong> <i>for six hundred
    thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men</i>" ( Ex 38: 26 )</p>
<p> "<i>Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, <strong>from twenty years old</strong></i> <strong> and
    upward</strong><i>, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and</i> <i> unto Jacob; because they
    have not wholly followed me</i>" ( Nm 32:11 )</p>
<p> "<strong>From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war</strong> <i>in</i> <i> Israel: thou
    and Aaron shall number them by their armies</i>." ( Nm 1: 3 )</p>
<p> "<i>And the children of Reuben, Israel's eldest son, by their generations,</i> <i> after their families, by the
    house of their fathers, according to the number of</i> <i> the names, by their polls, every male <strong>from twenty
    years old and upward, all</strong></i> <strong> that were able to go forth to war</strong>" ( Nm 1: 20 )</p>
<p><strong>Let's take a look at some of the unmarried ladies mentioned in the Bible</strong>, to see if we think they
    were just 13 year old girls.</p>
<p><strong>Zelophehad's daughters.</strong> These five ladies appear in three passages in the Scriptures. In Numbers 26:
    2 and 33 their names are given among those who were accounted for, because they were over 20 years old. Therefore it
    is perfectly logical to think that these ladies were over twenty.</p>
<p> "<strong>Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty</strong> <strong> years old and
    upward,</strong> <i>throughout their fathers' house, all that are able to go to</i> <i> war in Israel</i>." ��� ( Nm
    26: 2 )</p>
<p> ..."<i>And Zelophehad the son of Hepher had no sons, but daughters; and</i> <i> the names of the daughters of
    Zelophehad were: Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah,</i> <i> Milcah, and Tirzah</i>." ( Nm 26: 33 )</p>
<p> In Numbers 27:1- 4 these five sisters present themselves before Moses, the princes of Israel, and the whole
    congregation, and defended very wisely their right to the inheritance of their father.</p>
<p> "<i>Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of</i> <i> Gilead, the son of Machir, the son
    of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh</i> <i> the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters;
    Mahlah, Noah,</i> <i> and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah. <strong>And they stood before Moses, and
    before</strong></i> <strong> Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, by the
    door</strong> <strong> of the tabernacle of the congregation,</strong> <i>saying: Our father died in the
    wilderness,</i> <i> and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against</i> <i> the LORD
    in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons.</i> <i> <strong>Why should the name of our father
    be done away from among his family, because</strong></i> <strong> he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a
    possession among the brethren of our</strong> <strong> father</strong>." ( Numbers 27:1- 4 )</p>
<p> The way these ladies performed during those episodes, and the way they argued for their rights, does not certainly
    depict a bunch of immature teenagers, but on the contrary, five adult women. During all these occurrences, they were
    all single, as we can see later, at the end of the third passage. Therefore, it <strong>was not customary, as many
        people think, that women got married when they were 13, 15 or 17.</strong></p>
<p> "<i>2 The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance</i> <i> by lot to the children of Israel: and
    my lord was commanded by the LORD to give</i> <i> the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters. 3
    <strong>And if they be</strong></i> <strong> married</strong> <i>to any of the sons of the other tribes of the
    children of Israel, then shall</i> <i> their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers6 This is
    the</i> <i> thing which the LORD doth command <strong>concerning the daughters of Zelophehad,</strong></i> <strong>
    saying: Let them marry to whom they think best</strong><i>; only to the family <strong>of the tribe</strong></i> <i>
    of their father shall they marry<strong>...</strong> 10 Even as the LORD commanded Moses,</i> <i> so did the
    daughters of Zelophehad: 11 For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and</i> <i> Milcah, and Noah, <strong>the daughters of
    Zelophehad, were married unto</strong> their father's</i> <i> brothers' sons: And they were married into the
    families of the sons of Manasseh</i> <i> the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the
    family of their</i> <i> father</i>." ( Nm 36: 1-12 abbreviated )</p>
<p> As we can see, <strong>these women were single during all these occurrences,</strong> and being single, they could
    not be regarded as teenagers; they showed themselves as adult people. Therefore it is a mistake to think that women
    in Israel married at 13 or 17. Another fact that should be noticed is that <strong>women were not forced to marry
        against their own will, to whom their parents, grandparents or uncles wanted.</strong> They had some freedom of
    choice. In fact when Moses said: "<strong>Let them marry to whom they think best",</strong> he gave us an inkling
    that they had freedom of choice. Moses didn't say: "Let them marry to whom their grandpa or uncles want". Biblical
    customs have been distorted very much by people who equate other cultures to the biblical ones. <strong>Rebecca's
        marriage</strong>. The fact that the family asked Rebecca's opinion about the marriage does not incline me to
    think that she was a 13 or 15 year old girl. It is also evident that <strong>marriages were not just forced upon
        daughters.</strong></p>
<p> "<i>And they said, <strong>We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth</strong>. And they</i> <i> called
    Rebekah, and said unto her, <strong>Wilt thou go with this man?</strong> And she said,</i> <i> I will go</i>." (Gen
    24: 57-58)</p>
<p><strong>Female builders of Jerusalem walls.</strong> One of the men who rebuilt the walls around Jerusalem under
    Nehemiah, had his daughters working with him ( Neh 3:12 ). It stands to reason that if he had his daughters working
    with him in such a tough task, was because they were not married. Otherwise the ladies would have been taking care
    of their children and husband. In my opinion building the walls was not a job for a 13, 15 or 17 year old girl; they
    most probably were not teenagers, but strong women of age. Besides, because he had several daughters, evidently
    there were some of them that were older than others; and yet, the older ones were not married. Therefore, the idea
    that girls were married when they arrived to 13 or 15 years of age is not easy to believe. There are many cases
    registered in the Bible of women that were single, and it doesn't seem at all that they were teenagers.</p>
<p> "<i>And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh, the ruler of the</i> <i> half part of Jerusalem,
    <strong>he and his daughters</strong></i>." (Neh 3:12)</p>
<p><strong>Philip's daughters.</strong> This deacon had four daughters that <strong>were known because of their gift of
    prophecy.</strong> If they were already known for such a gift we have to conclude that it was not something that
    these ladies started to do the day before Paul arrived. If they had that gift for some time, and if there were four,
    it means that at least one of them, if not all of them, were of age. Not being teenagers, they were still single. It
    reaffirms the idea that women were not given to marriage when they were 13 or 16 years old.</p>
<p> "<i>And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto</i> <i> Caesarea: and we entered into
    the house of <strong>Philip the evangelist</strong>, which was</i> <i> one of the seven; and abode with him. And the
    same man had <strong>four daughters,</strong></i> <strong><i> virgins, which did prophesy</i>.</strong>" (Acts 21:8)
</p>
<p><strong>Queen Esther.</strong> If we read the book of Esther and we take note of her behavior, her wisdom, etc., it
    does not seem that she was a girl of 13 or 17 years of age when she was taken to king Ahasuerus. It looks as if she
    was already of age. In reading the Bible I cannot find an inkling of the supposed custom of marrying girls when they
    were 13 or 17. On the contrary I find several cases in which you can deem that those unmarried ladies were of age.
    <strong>That is why I don't believe that Virgin Mary was the exception. I don't think that she was a teenager when
        God entrusted her with His son.</strong> <strong>Any sensible father</strong> knows that a girl is not
    physically and psychologically mature until she is in her twenties. Would you be happy if your daughter wanted to
    get married when she is only thirteen, fifteen or seventeen? Will you be jumping for joy if your seventeen year old
    girl had a baby? Wouldn't you think that she has started too young, even when she is not physically nor
    psychologically prepared for such a burden? Sadly she has to start taking care of a husband and a family when she
    still needs to be taken care of. This is what I have alleged to many of my friends who think that Mary was a
    teenager when she married Joseph and when she had her baby Jesus. Of course they agreed that they, by no means,
    would like such a marriage for their teenage girls, but allege that it was the custom of the Israelite parents at
    that time. It is not true, as I have already demonstrated. Besides, they forget a very important fact: it was not
    Mary's parents who determined the age at which she was going to be laid with that burden, <strong>it was God
        Himself.</strong> Are we going to think that God did what a sensible father wouldn't? It stands to reason that
    God would give such a burden to Mary at the age that women are mature enough, both physically and psychologically,
    to perform her duties perfectly. Would God entrust His only begotten son to just a teenager 13, 15 or 17 years old?
    Would you? <strong>I have shown several biblical examples of single ladies that were perfectly adults. Can anyone
        show biblical examples of teenagers given in marriage?</strong> <strong>Regarding the supposed old age of
        Joseph</strong> it is enough to say that he took his wife Mary and traveled first to Bethlehem and later to
    Egypt. Certainly an 80 or 90 year old man in Roman times, was not able to perform such a feat. It is evident that he
    was a young man. If we read II Sam 19: 35 we will see that more than a thousand years before, men of such an age
    were already unable of such travels. When King David proposed his friend Barzillai to go with him to Jerusalem,
    Barzillai answered the following way:</p>
<p> "<i>I am this day <strong>fourscore years old</strong>; and can I discern between good and evil?</i> <i> can thy
    servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of</i> <i> singing men and singing women?
    wherefore then should thy servant be yet a</i> <i> burden unto my lord the king?</i>" ( II Sam 19: 35 )</p>
<p>The supposed old age of Joseph is another effort, another myth of Romanism to prop up the myth that Mary continued to
    be virgin her whole life, even after giving birth to Jesus. As Romanism wants to hold Virgin Mary sort of as a
    goddess, they invent such myths.</p>
<p>As we can see, Mary was not a teenager, nor Joseph an elderly.</p>
