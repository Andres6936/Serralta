    <title>The Crucifixion was on Thursday</title>
</head>
<body>
<p><strong>The Crucifixion of Christ was on Thursday, because he was in the tomb 3 days and 3 nights.</strong></p>
<p> Christ was not crucified on Friday, but on Thursday; the traditional interpretation that assures Christ was
    crucified on a Friday is false.</p>
<p> One day is composed of a period of darkness (night), and a period of light (day). We must remember that the Hebrews
    would count days starting at the break of nighttime. For them, the day would end at nightfall but as soon as the
    stars would come out, it would mark the beginning of a new day. That moment began the period of darkness, or the
    nighttime of the following day. Later, at the break of dawn, is when the period of light would begin for the day
    that begun the previous night.</p>
<p> Here it says that Jonah stayed in a whale's belly, and Jesus in the heart of the earth, for three days and three
    nights respectively. Give or take a few hours and that is roughly 72 hours. But not 12 hours less, or 12 hours
    more.</p>
<p></p>
<p> "<i>For as Jonas was <strong>three days and three nights</strong> in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be
    <strong>three days and three nights</strong> in the heart of the earth</i>. (Mt 12:40)</p>
<p> If we read the case of Jonah, we will also see that it <strong>specifically</strong> states that Jonah was in the
    belly of the fish three days and three nights.</p>
<p></p>
<p> "<i>Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish <strong>three
    days and three nights</strong></i>. (Jon 2:1)</p>
<p> By what we read in Mathew 12:40, we can be assured that at the very least Jesus spent some hours in the period of
    light, and some hours in the period of darkness on the first and last days on the crucifixion. It's to say that even
    though it doesn't add up to exactly 72 hours, Jesus was in the heart of the earth, as a minimum, part of the first
    initial period of light and part of the final period of darkness. <strong>There is no doubt whatsoever that he
        participated in all six halves of the day: three periods of daytime and three periods of nighttime</strong>.
    Therefore, this verse makes me think that Jesus was crucified on Thursday, somewhere around 9 o'clock AM, and died
    around 3 o'clock PM that same Thursday.</p>
<p>Let's make a diagram representing each period of darkness and each period of light. Let's represent the moment of his
    death with a <strong>"D"</strong> and the moment of his resurrection with an <strong>"R"</strong>. The time in
    between the "D" and the "R" is the time Jesus was in the heart of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>___D__ _________ __________ _________ _______ ________R_ ________</strong></p>
<p>Thu day Fri night Fri day Sat night Sat day Sun night Sun day</p>
<p></p>
<p> As we can see graphically, in the case I try to make, Christ was in the heart of the earth for at least part of
    Thursday, all night on Friday, all day on Friday, all night on Saturday, all day on Saturday, and at least in part
    on Sunday night, resurrecting before the period of light on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>In the case that we all accept the 3 days and 3 nights</strong>, which is what the Lord says, the most you
    could allege on the contrary is that part of the day in one of both extremes (Thursday) he wasn't dead, but at least
    part of the day (Thursday) he was in the heart of the earth. The same can be said with the night of the other
    extreme (Sunday); it could be that he wasn't in the heart of the earth on the final part of Sunday night, but at
    least he was dead in the period of darkness on Sunday, before the break of dawn. This tells us that Christ could not
    have been crucified on Friday, but on Thursday.</p>
<p> Now let's look at another diagram from a different point of view. The same issue, but this time as it is
    traditionally taught, assuming the crucifixion was on Friday.</p>
<p> ______D__ ____________ __________ __________R___ ____________</p>
<p> Fri day Sat night Sat day Sun night Sun day</p>
<p></p>
<p> As you can see, if we adopted the traditional teachings, there is no way Jesus could have been in the heart of the
    earth for 3 days and 3 nights. The maximum amount of time he could have spent was 2 days and 2 nights. <strong>This
        doesn't match with what was said by the Lord, who was very specific and clear</strong>. Therefore, the argument
    concerning Jesus' crucifixion on Friday can simply not be true.</p>
<p> Concerning what I said on Christ being crucified at 9 in the morning and dying around 3 in the afternoon, to say
    such a thing, I base myself on Mr 15:25 and 34-37. Keep in mind that they counted the 12 light hours of the day,
    starting at the break of day, in other words starting at what we would call 6 in the morning; and the watchers of
    the night were counted at nightfall. Therefore, what they called 3 were what today we call 9 in the morning, and
    what they called 9 was actually three in the afternoon.</p>
<p></p>
<p> "<i>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him</i>." (Mrk 15:25)</p>
<p></p>
<p>"34 <strong>And at the ninth hour</strong> <i>Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying: Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?
    Which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</i> 35 <i>And some of them that stood by,
    when they heard it, said: Behold, he calleth Elias.</i> 36 <i>And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and
    put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.</i>
    37 <i>And Jesus cried <strong>with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost</strong></i>. (Mrk 15:34-37)</p>
<p><strong>The Traditions aren't bad in themselves, bad is when the tradition substitutes the Scriptures</strong>.
    Anytime a tradition isn't rejected by the Bible or common sense, it can be accepted; but when the bible contradicts
    the tradition, it should be rejected. That's why it's good to read the Bible on a daily basis, in order, without
    skipping, starting with Genesis, finishing with Revelation, and starting back again with Genesis. We should do this
    while we still live, without thinking that we've read it all or read it enough. Every so often new difficulties
    arise that need to be analyzed. It's only by reading the entire Bible one more time that we'll resolve any arguments
    or difficulties along the way.</p>
