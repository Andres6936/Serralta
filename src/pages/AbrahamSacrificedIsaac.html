<p><strong>ABRAHAM SACRIFICED ISAAC KNOWING THAT</strong></p>
<p><strong>GOD WOULD RAISE HIM FROM THE DEAD</strong></p>
<p>In many occasions the interpretation of a biblical passage can be done through other passages in a different book of
  the Bible. In this case, in order to find the answer about Abraham, we would have to go to the epistle of Paul to the
  Hebrews.</p>
<p>God had promised Abraham in Gen 17:21 that <strong>Isaac would be the heir of the spiritual promise.</strong> In Gen
  22:1-2 when God tells Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac, in whom was the promise, <strong>Abraham logically thought
    if God had promised that Isaac would be the heir, He would fulfill His promise</strong>. Therefore, if he (Abraham)
  would sacrifice Isaac, God would bring him back to life some way or another, since God doesn't lie. In Heb 11:17-19
  Paul explains Gen 17:21 by saying, "….<strong>accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the
    dead….</strong>".</p>
<p>"<i>But <strong>my covenant will I establish with Isaac</strong>, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time
  in the next year</i>." ( Gen 17:21 )</p>
<p>"1 <i>And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham; and he said,
  Behold, here I am.</i> 2 <i>And He said: Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into
  the land of Moriah; and <strong>offer him there for a burnt offering</strong> upon one of the mountains which I will
  tell thee of</i>." ( Gen 22:1-2 )</p>
<p>"17 <i>By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac; and he that had received the promises offered up his
  only begotten son,</i> 18 <i>of whom it was said, that in Isaac shall thy seed be called.</i> 19
  <strong>Accounting</strong> <strong>that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead</strong><i>; from whence
    also he received him in a figure</i>." ( Heb 11:17-19 )</p>
<p>It clearly shows how Abraham <strong>was sure</strong> that he could sacrifice Isaac, there was no way he would loose
  him. He would come back to him even if God had to raise him from the dead.</p>
