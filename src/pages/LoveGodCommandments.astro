<p><strong>The true love for God is obedience to His commandments</strong></p>
<p> James said that faith was demonstrated by works<strong>.</strong> <strong>That's true.</strong> Faith is not
    seen<strong>,</strong> not smelled<strong>,</strong> is not heard<strong>,</strong> does not have
    taste<strong>,</strong> cannot be touched<strong>.</strong> Faith is observed by the acts of those who have
    faith<strong>.</strong> In other words<strong>,</strong> whoever truly has faith<strong>,</strong> feels compelled
    to work<strong>,</strong> in which case<strong>,</strong> whoever observes him<strong>,</strong> notices that he
    truly has faith<strong>.</strong> If someone says he has faith and not works<strong>,</strong> he truly does not
    have faith<strong>,</strong> he only says he does<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Something similar can be said about our love for God.</strong> Our love for God cannot be
    seen<strong>,</strong> not smelled<strong>,</strong> is not heard<strong>,</strong> does not have
    taste<strong>,</strong> cannot be touched<strong>.</strong> Love for God is perceived by the obedience of those who
    love God<strong>.</strong> In other words<strong>,</strong> whoever truly has love for God<strong>,</strong> feels
    compelled to obey Him<strong>,</strong> in which case<strong>,</strong> whoever observes him<strong>,</strong>
    notices that he truly has love for God<strong>.</strong> If someone says he has love for God and doesn't obey
    Him<strong>,</strong> he truly does not have love for God<strong>,</strong> he only says he does<strong>.</strong>
</p>
<p> He who truly loves God demonstrates it by searching for and obeying his commandments<strong>.</strong> He who says
    he loves God and does not inquire about his commandments in order to obey them<strong>,</strong> in reality does not
    love God<strong>.</strong> He only <strong>"</strong>says<strong>"</strong> he loves Him<strong>.</strong> It is not
    possible or logical to know the greatness and immensity of God<strong>,</strong> love Him and not obey his
    commandments</p>
<p> For those who distort everything<strong>,</strong> saying that <strong>"</strong>love<strong>"</strong> is above all
    the commandments of God they should realize that according to one of Jesus' disciples<strong>,</strong> love is when
    we walk according to His commandments<strong>,</strong> not simply the <strong>"</strong>blah<strong>,</strong> blah<strong>,</strong>
    blah<strong>"</strong> of <strong>"</strong>I love you<strong>".</strong> We should walk according to
    <strong>all</strong> of His commandments<strong>,</strong> not just some of them<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong>5 <i>And now I beseech thee<strong>,</strong> lady<strong>,</strong> not as though I wrote a new
    commandment unto thee<strong>,</strong> but that which we had from the beginning<strong>,</strong> that we love one
    another<strong>.</strong></i> 6 <strong><i>And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the
    commandment, that, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it</i>."</strong> (II John
    1<strong>:</strong>5-6)</p>
<p> Therefore<strong>,</strong> contrary to what many may think<strong>,</strong> it is possible to abide by His
    commandments<strong>,</strong> because if this wasn't possible<strong>,</strong> John would not exhort us to do
    so<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>God has given us commandments for our benefit and protection.</strong> It is the same as the father who
    protects his five year old daughter who wants to cross the street by herself<strong>.</strong> If the Supreme
    Being<strong>,</strong> He who knows above all<strong>,</strong> gives a commandment<strong>,</strong> it is
    stupidity to twist it<strong>,</strong> <strong>"</strong>modernize<strong>"</strong> it<strong>,</strong> consider
    it to be of little importance<strong>,</strong> etc<strong>..</strong> This is the same as the care of an automobile<strong>.</strong>
    If we follow the guidelines of the manual in some things and not others<strong>,</strong> the car will function well
    in some aspects and not in others<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> It appears that Solomon believed that some commandments were for persons of <strong>"</strong>olden
    times<strong>"</strong> or that were not very important<strong>,</strong> and paid a terrible price because of
    this<strong>.</strong> If you obey 99 commandments and transgress one hundredth<strong>,</strong> you will suffer
    from the evil for which that commandment which you transgressed was made for<strong>.</strong></p>
