  FIRST FATHERS WAS GIVEN IN YEARS, NOT IN MONTHS OR MOONS.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>
<FONT face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People exist who are
try to deny the fact that our first fathers (Adam, Seth, etc.) used to live
for centuries.&nbsp; They allege that the years mentioned in those chapters
are really "months" or "moons". <B>The <U>only</U> base for their absurd
hypothesis is</B> that if the number of years mentioned in the Bible for
the antediluvian patriarchs ages is divided by 12, the result is a number
of years <B>"more acceptable" <U>to them</U>.</B></FONT>
<BR>
<FONT face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As an example they
show that if&nbsp; 930 years, the biblical age of Adam, is divided by 12
the quotient is 77 years.&nbsp; If Methuselah's age ( 969 ) is divided by
12 months the quotient is almost 81 years, and so on.</FONT>
<BR>
<FONT face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>When human beings
want to deny God, or the authority of the Bible, they appeal to any nonsense,
without using discernment, logic or scientific methods</B>. Mankind made
up this hypothesis and clothed it with the cloak of science.</FONT>
<BR>
<FONT face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>These "enlightened
ones"</B> who thought they found the "explanation" of the longevity of the
patriarchs, didn't make any effort in reasoning even superficially the issue.
That's why they charged against this passage wantonly and irresponsibly,
thinking joyfully, that they have "discovered" a flaw in the Scriptures or
in its interpretations.&nbsp; That is why they solemnly declare that in this
passage the "so called" years, were just "moons" or "months". They declare
all this without noticing that before their own eyes is the denial of their
foolish hypothesis. Let us read Gen 5: 3-17.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's use a little
math:&nbsp; 130 moons divided by 12 = 10.8 years;&nbsp; 105 moons divided
by 12 = 8.75 years;&nbsp; 90 moons divided by 12= 7.5 years;&nbsp; 70 moons
divided by 12 = 5.8 years; and 65 moons divided by 12= 5.41 years.</FONT>
<BR>
<FONT face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If what these "enlightened
ones" say is true, then Adam, according to verse 3, had a son when he was
almost eleven years old; Seth had his first born when he was less than nine
(verse 6);&nbsp; Enos when he was less than eight (verse 9); Cainan when
he was almost six years old, (verse 12); and <B>Mahaleel had a son when he
was just <U>five and a half</U> years old,</B> according to verse 15. <B>As
we can see their hypothesis is absolutely illogical, and not
scientific.</B></FONT>
<BR>
<FONT face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is evident that
not everyone who claims to be a scientist or to use scientific methods, is
saying the truth.&nbsp; True science and true religion have to coincide,
because true science can only discover what God has created, and true
religion&nbsp; can say only what God said.&nbsp; What some people forget
is that when <B>our first fathers were 500 years old, they were as strong
as an actual 35 or 40 years old man.</B></FONT>
<BR>
<FONT face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The saddest thing
of all this is that&nbsp; "Christian leaders" exist who believe these nonsensical
hypothesis.</B>&nbsp; Sure enough, many years ago I was taken by surprise
when my Sunday School teacher, <B>who was a medical doctor</B> said: "With
the knowledge I have of the human body I can assure you that nobody can live
that long".&nbsp; Immediately he went to the blackboard and started to divide
the total age of each patriarch by twelve, to "demonstrate" that the "so
called" years were really "months" or "moons".</FONT>
<BR>
<FONT face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I went to the
blackboard and divided by twelve the age at which those patriarchs had their
first son, the only argument that came to his mind was to say: "Well, in
different eras they counted time in different ways". Then I replied: "We
are talking about the same passage, the same verse, and even the same man,
not of different eras".</FONT>
<BR>
<FONT face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>It is very common
that the hypertrophic ego of many brothers preclude them from rectifying
in private, much less in public.</B>&nbsp; This man was a&nbsp; Christian,
he was not trying to harm the faith. His problem was that he had stuffed
his mind with lots of pseudo scientific hypothesis.&nbsp; Sadly with the
authority he had by virtue of being a&nbsp; medical doctor and a Sunday School
teacher, he was unwillingly harming the faith of his brethren, who knew he
was a scientist and an honest man.&nbsp; Sure enough, <B>he was honest, but
was honestly wrong,</B> and <B>the teachings of those brothers who are honestly
wrong, are the worst of all.</B></FONT>
