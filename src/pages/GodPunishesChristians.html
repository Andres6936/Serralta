<FONT size="5"><B> YES, GOD PUNISHES CHRISTIANS ALSO</B></FONT>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many times, I would say most of the times, God punishes
human beings; both, in order for them to learn something, and because their
deeds deserve punishment. Many other times though, God punishes because what
was done requires punishment without trying to educate the person education.
The fact that Christians are saved by Jesus <B> does not mean that we can
sin with impunity</B>. The most that it means, is that if our sins don't
reach a certain level, also hardening us, we keep our salvation; but even
within this state of salvation we are going to receive the punishments that
fit our sins. Let's read what Paul says:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<I>For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be
  judged. But when we are judged, <B> we are chastened of the Lord</B>, that
  we should not be condemned with the world</I>."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (
  I Co 11: 31-32 )
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Christian has to go very far in sinning for him to loose
his salvation; <B> but he doesn't have to go farther than an unbeliever to
receive the same earthly punishments for his sins, <U> or even harder
punishments</U></B>. On the authority of Jesus Christ in Luke 12: 47, a servant
who knows his master's will and won't act accordingly, will be punished harder.
According to the Apostle Peter, in Acts 10: 34, God does not favor a person
over another and therefore, in the presence of the same sin and circumstances,
He inflicts the same punishment.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<I>And <B>that servant, which knew his lord's will</B>,
  and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, <B> shall be
  beaten with many stripes</B></I>."&nbsp; ( Luke 12: 47 )
  <P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<I>Then Peter opened his mouth, and said: Of a truth
  I perceive that <B> God is no respecter of persons</B></I>." ( Acts 10: 34
  )
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Sin has earthly and eternal consequences</B>. Both
consequences have to be suffered. Our eternal consequences were forgiven
in Christ, <B> after our <U> sincere</U> repentance;</B> but not the earthly
ones, which will grab us, as we saw in I Co 11: 31-32. We will find the same
thing in Heb 12: 6-8. Let's see:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<I><B>For whom the Lord loves he chastens, and scourges
  every son whom he receives</B>. If ye endure chastening, God deals with you,
  as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chastens not? But if ye
  be without chastisement, <B> whereof all are partakers, then are ye
  bastards</B>, and not sons</I>." ( Heb 12: 6-8 )
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>There are those who sin, and at the same time suffer.
These people, instead of understanding the existing link between their sins
and their sufferings</B>, prefer to believe that they have no consequences
to pay for any sin they have committed and will further commit, while on
the other hand, they do not understand why they are suffering.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>People who think like this believe that God makes two
wrongs at the same time</B>: Firstly, they think that He punishes the bad
deeds of an unbeliever, but He does not punish the same bad deeds in of a
Christian. Secondly, they believe that He sends sufferings to Christians
though they do not give any reason for having to suffer. Why do we have to
be that foolish?
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose that Christians that think that way, do so as
sort of a psychological subconscious defense, in which they protect their
lusts. <B> They deeply love their lusts, and do not want to leave them even
though they make themselves suffer. They also do not want to loose their
salvation, which they love just a little more than their lusts.</B> They
know, or sense, that if they recognize that God is punishing them, and still
persist on sinning, this could become a rejection to the Holy Spirit, which
is an unforgivable sin. Though, they prefer to "convince" themselves that
this is not what is happening; instead, they choose to believe that all their
sins were forgiven immediately after being committed, while their sufferings
and punishments are due to some "unknown mystery". That is why we hear foolish
explanations like, "God is testing me, brother", or, "In this life we cannot
be happy, brother", or, "These are mysterious happenings, brother".
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>In Tthis way, they feel <U> artificially</U> "free"
to keep "enjoying" their lusts, without loosing their salvation</B>. It This
is something similar to what goes on in the minds of drunkards, drug addicts
and sexual addicts. Though they see clearly that their lusts are causing
them great suffering, they prefer to undergo those sufferings in order to
keep "enjoying" their lusts.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>It is very clear in I Co 11: 31-32, that God punishes
not only as a teaching method, but also as a way of making justice</B>. If
it says that by being judged (verse 32) we are punished, then this punishment
is not for teaching purposes, because, <B> to be taught, we do not have to
be judged.</B>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christians are <B> not</B> going to pay for their sins
in eternity; we are going to pay for them here. <B> Here we are punished.</B>
That is why instead of Christians being above all other peoples, we are many
times under them. Being children of God, brothers and sisters of Jesus Christ,
we are the treaded ones. <B> We have to pay here for the bad deeds that we
have committed here, because later we will not have to pay anything.</B>
However, the contrary happens with the unbelievers. Their good deeds have
to be paid to them on earth, because later, in eternity, they are not going
to receive any reward.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same doctrine is taught by the Apostle Paul in Ga
6: 7 and Col 3: 25, where he says the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<I>Be not deceived; God is not mocked, for </I><B><I>
  whatsoever a man sows, that shall he also reap</I>.</B>" ( Ga 6: 7 )
  <P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<I>But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong
  which he hath done; and <B> there is no respect of persons</B></I>." ( Col
  3: 25 )
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In spite of all these clear passages, there are some who
think that God does not punish Christians, but only teaches them. <B> Paul,
speaking to Christians and referring to them</B>, says that Christians should
not harm their brethren, because <B> God <U> avenges</U> those bad deeds.</B>
Vengeance is not a teaching act, but a punishing act. <B> It is just logical
that it must be like this, because God is not a respecter of persons</B>.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<I>That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any
  matter: because that <B> the Lord is the avenger of all such</B>, as we also
  have forewarned you and testified</I>." ( I The 4: 6 )
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, according to all that we have read, not only
does correction for education exist, but so does punishment without education.
And iIf this occur occurs to us, Christians who are saved, <B> it is also
logical that it has to take place <U> here</U> and <U>now</U>, because after
our deaths there will not be punishments for us</B>.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the last verse we read, we see that Paul had already
told the people about this matter, because he says: "as we also have <B>
forewarned</B> you and testified". If he uses the word "forewarned", it is
because they hadn't obeyed him. Similarly, nowadays there are Christians
that <B> do not want to believe</B> that the Lord punishes Christians also.
It is best for them to awake on time, so that when the punishments come,
they don't start with foolish complaints like: "These are tests, brother"
or "These are mysteries, brother".
