<Layout title="Michael the archangel is not Christ">
    <section>
<strong>Michael the archangel is not Christ, he is just that: an archangel. There are several archangels.</strong>
<p><strong>There are those who try to de-christianize Christianity without being noticed by Christians. </strong> They
    use several crooked methods, depending on the denomination they are working in. One of the methods is to join a
    denomination and then destroy or at least maim its Christian doctrines from the inside out. <strong>Russellites
        spread the heretic idea that Jesus and Michael the Archangel are the same person.</strong> If they directly
    rejected Christ then Christians would notice it. So, instead, without directly rejecting Christ, they subtly deny
    his divinity by transforming him into just an archangel. They are very shrewd in doing evil and in a very clever
    way. <strong>The sad part is that there are many good Christians</strong> that recognize Christ's divinity, and
    still believe that he and Michael, the Archangel, are the same person. Let us see what the Scriptures say about it.
</p>
<p> "5 <i>Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed</i> <i> in linen,whose loins were
    girded with fine gold of Uphaz,</i> 6 <i>his body also was</i> <i> like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of
    lightning, and his eyes as lamps</i> <i> of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and
    the voice</i> <i> of his words like the voice of a multitude. ï¿½..</i>13 <i>But the prince of the kingdom</i> <i> of
    Persia withstood me one and twenty days; but, lo, Michael, <strong>one of the chief</strong></i> <strong>
    princes</strong><i>, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia</i>." ( Dan 10: 5-13 abbreviated
    )</p>
<p> In this passage the angel who speaks to Daniel says several things that <strong>demonstrate that Michael cannot be
    Christ.</strong> Let us scrutinize this passage. <strong>First.</strong> The angel who speaks to Daniel <strong>refers
    to Michael as a peer</strong>, not as someone superior. The angel speaks of Michael as one who is just helping him .
    <strong>Jesus is this angel's Lord, not his peer.</strong> Therefore, if he refers to Michael as his peer and not as
    his Lord, it is because Michael is not Jesus. <strong>Second.</strong> Let us focus our attention to the fact that
    according to the angel who speaks to Daniel, <strong>Michael is one of several, he is not unique.</strong> We know
    that the angel thinks this because of his phrase "one of the chief princes". <strong>If the angel used the word
        "princes" in plural</strong>, it is because he knows that there are several others like Michael. This means that
    Michael is not the only one of his kind, but just <strong>one of them, one of several</strong>. If there are several
    like Michael, then that means that <strong>there are several archangels.</strong> If Michael is "one of the chief
    princes" is because he is not the chief of them all. It is true that Michael is the only archangel mentioned by
    name, but evidently he is not the only archangel. <strong>On the other hand, Jesus is the only begotten
        son;</strong> the only one of his kind. If Michael is not the only one of his kind, he cannot be Jesus. <strong>Third.</strong>
    As we read verse 21 of this same chapter 10 we learn that the angel who spoke to Daniel said that Michael is the
    prince of the Hebrew people. He limited him to just a race, just a nation; and Jesus is Lord and King of all
    nations. Thus, Michael cannot be Jesus.</p>
<p> "<i>But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth; and there</i> <i> is none that holdeth with
    me in these things, but <strong>Michael your prince</strong></i>." ( Dan 10: 21 )</p>
<p><strong>Fourth.</strong> If we read Jude 1:9 we learn of a fight, a dispute between Michael the Archangel and the
    Devil, about something that had to do with Moses' body. <strong>Jesus does not have to fight or dispute with the
        Devil. Jesus only has to give him orders, period.</strong> Satan is in no way a match for Jesus! Jesus is
    divine! Satan is just a creature. This power of Christ was evident even when Jesus was on the earth, clothed with
    flesh, made a little lower than angels. During the temptation Jesus ordered Satan to leave, <strong>and he had to
        leave.</strong> He could not argue with Christ, or resist him, or merely dispute with him. <strong>Satan just
        had to obey Jesus at once.</strong> Therefore if Michael had to <strong>dispute</strong> with Satan, it is
    because Michael is not Christ, but a being of much lower category than Jesus.</p>
<p> "<i>Yet Michael the archangel, when <strong>contending with the Devil he disputed</strong></i> <i> about the body of
    Moses, <strong>durst not</strong> bring against him a railing accusation,</i> <i> but said, <strong>The Lord rebuke
    thee</strong></i><strong>.</strong>" ( Jude 1: 9 )</p>
<p> When a legion of demons were possessing a man in the region of the Gergesenes, Jesus did not have to dispute with
    them; he just ordered them to leave the possessed man and <strong>they had to do so.</strong> All through the
    gospels we see that demons feared Jesus and begged him not to cast them into the abyss. This shows us what an
    authority and potency Jesus had even being in flesh. Jesus did not have to dispute, contend or struggle with demons,
    he just had to speak, and that was it. How then can Russellites convince anyone that Jesus is Michael the Archangel?
    <strong>Fifth.</strong> We also can see in Jude 1: 9 that Michael <strong>did not dare</strong> to bring a railing
    accusation against Satan. Are Russellites saying that Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God cannot
    <strong>dare</strong> to rebuke Satan? He is the Lord! He can do whatever he wants to do! He is, and always has
    been, the Lord of all the angels, including Satan and demons. The one that cannot dare to do anything against Jesus
    is Satan, and not vice versa. <strong>Sixth.</strong> In this same verse of Jude, Michael said: "The Lord rebuke
    thee". If Michael asked the Lord to rebuke Satan it is because <strong>Michael did not consider that he was the
        Lord</strong>, therefore Michael is not the Lord Jesus Christ. It is clear that <strong>the job Satan has given
        the Russellites is to creep into Christianity and destroy or harm it from the inside out.</strong> They are
    trying to identify Jesus with Michael the Archangel in order to degrade Jesus. <strong>This is a Russellite heresy
        that many Christians have just gulped down,</strong> without realizing neither its theological consequences nor
    how heretical the concept really is.</p>
<p> "28 <i>And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes,</i> <i> there met him two
    possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, <strong>exceeding</strong></i> <strong> fierce, so that no man might
    pass by that way.</strong> 29 <i>And, behold, they cried out,</i> <i> saying, <strong>What have we to do with thee,
    Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither</strong></i> <strong> to torment us before the time?</strong> 30 <i>And
    there was a good way off from them an herd</i> <i> of many swine feeding. </i> 31 <i>So the <strong>devils besought
    him</strong>, saying, If thou cast us out,</i> <i> suffer us to go away into the herd of swine. </i> 32 <i>And he
    said unto them, Go. And when</i> <i> they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole
    herd</i> <i> of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters</i>." ( Matt 8:
    28-32 )</p>
<p> As we can see, these demons were exceedingly fierce, but before the divine presence of Jesus Christ they humiliated
    themselves, they besought and begged. Jesus did not have to struggle, or dispute with them, so that they would leave
    the possessed man. Jesus' presence terrified them, because they were not sure if he was already going to cast them
    into the abyss. Christ's order was enough, they humbly obeyed Jesus: they left the possessed man at once. This same
    case happened with Satan during Jesus' temptation. Christ did not have to struggle with Satan so that he would
    leave. Jesus only had to order Satan to get out, and Satan obeyed promptly and humbly; he knew he could not do
    anything else before a divine being as Jesus is. A very different picture is seen in the case of Michael. The
    archangel had to contend, had to struggle with Satan. <strong>It is more than evident that Jesus and Michael are not
        the same person.</strong> <strong>Michael could not order Satan to leave; he had to struggle with him</strong>.
    Michael even needed peers to help him in his struggle. On the other hand, Jesus alone, by himself, was more than
    enough to put Satan in his place, he did not need any help. No real Christian, who knows that Christ is divine, is
    going to accept that Jesus "durst not " or had to "contend" with the Devil. Satan is no match at all for Jesus.
    Satan found it impossible to destroy Christianity from the outside. He could not destroy Christianity with
    persecutions and tortures. This is why he infiltrates it and tries to destroy it from the inside out. <a
