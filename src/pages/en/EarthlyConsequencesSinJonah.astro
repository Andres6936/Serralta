  </SPAN>Jonah was already beginning to suffer the consequences of his disobedience
        towards God's commandments. Due to his defiance, he found himself in the
        middle of a storm that threatened the lives of others. This has to torment
        the mind of anyone who has a conscience. Even the unbelievers would reproach
        him for defying God. That's why they said: &#147;Why have you done this?&#148;
        Here came another consequence for his sin.

  </SPAN>Did you think Jonah would go unpunished for his disobedience of God's
        commandments? Let's say you ride on an airplane sometime in the future and
        in the middle of the trip, you see the two engines catch on fire. Would you
        suffer a great deal? <SPAN class=GramE>Would you know if the problem could
  be fixed or not?</SPAN> If after hydroplaning safely into the middle of the
        ocean you learned that the radio was broken, no one could report this
        catastrophe, and the plane began to sink; what would your state of mind be?
        Would you feel bitterness due to the lack of hope? Is this punishment? Isn't
        this something similar to what Jonah experienced?
    <P>
  <SPAN style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </SPAN>If after the airplane had sunk, and after swimming through waves for
        a great deal of time, you see huge fins around you in the water, wouldn't
        the desperation be multiplied? Would you have any faith left in you? And
        if after minutes of uncertainty you see an enormous fin coming directly towards
        you; how many of you would stay calm? Isn't this horrible punishment?
        <SPAN class=GramE>If you see an enormous monster coming to attack you.</SPAN>
        How many of you would stay calm and in good spirit? Isn't this terrible
        punishment? This same thing is what Jonah suffered.

        who allow themselves to be influenced by a "faith" they don't have, </B>would
        have resisted this without losing control. When your faith becomes weak,
        that is when you realize the severity of a situation. That is when you realize
        that you are in the stomach of a great fish and seconds go by&#133; and nothing
        happens; and minutes &#133; and nothing, and hours go by&#133; and you are
        being digested. Who wouldn&#146;t have suffered bitterly?

  </SPAN>We can say the same thing about problems, unpleasantness, and sufferings
        of all kinds that <SPAN class=GramE>supervene</SPAN> Christians. Don't believe
        that a "fish" would swallow a Christian just by chance. <SPAN class=GramE>On

  the ground without the acknowledgement of the father.</SPAN>

        even death, which is why we do not touch it. Even a person, who is not civilized
        or is too young to omit the <SPAN class=GramE>warnings</SPAN> would suffer
        the consequences. It doesn't matter if this person ignores the fact that
        electricity exists; it doesn't matter if this person has a lot of faith in
        the assumption that electricity doesn't exist; it doesn't matter that this
        person would have convinced himself that there are no consequences; if he
        touches the electrical cords, he will suffer the consequences.

        If we are "uncivilized", or "not mature" enough in reference to the dynamics
        ruled by the laws of the spiritual world, (the other "dimension", that has
        to do with ourselves), we will be "electrocuted", embittered, "swallowed",
        etc. This will happen as we don't proceed according to the way Creation has
        been ordained in reference to everything spiritual.
