&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In ancient times it was not easy
to make cloth, it required much time and effort. That's why cloth was scarce
and expensive. Most of the times women made their own family cloth and clothes.
First they had to gather raw wool or linen and make yarn or threads out of
it, spinning by hand, because at that time the distaff did not exist. Later
they had to make the warp, which was a set of yarns placed lengthwise, parallel
to each other, in order to weave transverse threads to make the cloth. The
loom did not exist yet, and everything had to be made by hand, by women,
in their home. <B> In short, cloth was scarce and expensive, and poor people
used just the necessary amount to get warm or to cover his nudity.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you have been in a museum where statues of that time are exhibited, you&nbsp;
will remember that poor women wore their clothing little under the knee, and
poor men from the loins to half the thigh.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In modern times almost any person
can have several shirts and pants, or several dresses, because modern machinery
has extraordinarily cheapen cloth. Nowadays anyone can buy enough cloth to
be dressed from his head to his feet. That's why many people don't understand
why clothes were so important in ancient times. At that time, to have long
clothing meant to be well to do. Poor men only used enough cloth to make
short clothing. It was a signal of status to use long clothing, robes, or
any other unnecessary piece of cloth.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus was a poor man, he was a
carpenter, and he could not afford long clothing, much less robes. Therefore
it is logical that he dressed himself with short clothing and with no robes.
Nevertheless, for some kind of misunderstanding, people who make pictures
of Jesus always depict him using long clothing and even robes. If we read
Mark 12: 38 and Luke 20: 46 we will see that Jesus was advising his listeners
to be aware of the fact that scribes wanted to wear long clothing.
<P style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<I>And he said unto them in his
doctrine: Beware of the scribes, which <B> love to go in <U> long
clothing</U></B>, and love salutations in the
marketplaces</I>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Mark 12: 38 )
<P style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<I><B>Beware of the scribes,
which desire to walk in long robes</B>, and love greetings in the markets,
and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at
feasts</I>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Luke 20: 46 )
<P style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>It is not logical to think
that while Jesus was advising the disciples about the using of long clothing
by the scribes, he himself was wearing one of them</B>. At the time, robes
and long clothing for men was a sign of useless luxury. It didn't become
to Jesus to be clothed like that. Especially when he was saying what we read
in the former two verses.
<P style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">
If we read John 19: 23 we will see that Jesus' tunic was made of only one
piece, something like a tube. Therefore it couldn't be that long because
it would hinder walking freely.
<P style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<I>Then the soldiers, when they
had crucified Jesus, took His garments and made four parts, to each soldier
a part, and also the tunic. Now <B> the tunic was without seam, woven from
the top in one
piece</B></I>."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( John&nbsp; 19:23 )
<P style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>In short,</B> pictures depicting
Jesus in long clothing and robes are out reality. The misrepresentation of
Jesus had been so general, that this concept of a Jesus dressed in short
clothing, like a Hebrew labor, or like a Roman soldier, would not be easily
accepted by the vast majority of Christians.
