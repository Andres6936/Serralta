        <u6:p></u6:p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In our
        lives we continually see that, as Ecc 8<b>:</b> 14 states<b>,</b> there are
        wicked people who seem to live happy lives<b>;</b> meanwhile<b>,</b> there are
        also believers who suffer<b>.</b> There are two explanations for this apparent
        contradiction<b>:</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span><b>a)</b> if God
        were to immediately execute anyone who commits a sin<b>,</b> nobody<b>,</b> or
        very few people would dare to do bad deeds<b>,</b> but their wicked feelings
        would still stay in their souls<b>;</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span><b>b)</b> both<b>,</b> pro-God and anti-God do good deeds and commit
        sins<b>,</b> and both require retribution<b>.</b> Let's explain<b>.</b></p>

    <p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp; &nbsp; From what is said
        in Ecc 8<b>:</b> 14 and from the observation of daily life<b>,</b> we realize
        that God loving people suffer what we deem God's enemies should suffer<b>,</b>
        and vice versa<b>.</b> This same idea we can get from Psalms 17<b>:</b> 13-14<b>;</b>
        73<b>:</b> 2-5 and 12-14<b>.</b> &nbsp;Let's read them<b>.

    <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>
        <u6:p></u6:p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b><u>First</u>,
        not everything that an anti God person does is negative; nor everything a God
        loving does is positive. God is just He won't fail to punish what is wrong nor
        will He fail to reward what is good.</b> This reward and this punishment have
        two phases<b>:</b> the physical and the eternal<b>;</b> or better said<b>,</b>
        the earthly or temporary<b>,</b> and the spiritual or eternal<b>.</b> This
        concept is something that can be observed and also can be read in the Bible<b>.</b>
    </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp; &nbsp;
        When David committed adultery ( II Sam 12<b>:</b> 13 )<b>,</b> <b>God forgave
            the eternal consequences of his sins</b> when Nathan said <b>�</b>�The LORD
        also hath put away thy sin�<b>�;</b> <b>but God kept on David, the earthly and
            temporary consequences of his actions,</b> which were prophesied in II Sam 12<b>:</b>
        10-11 and 14<b>.</b></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp; &nbsp; We
        can draw this same conclusion from our observation of life around us<b>.</b> <b>A
            man murders another,</b> and because of this we know he will receive eternal
        condemnation<b>;</b> but he could also suffer earthly consequences<b>:</b>
        maybe he'll go to jail<b>,</b> or be hated by the murdered man's relatives and
        friends<b>,</b> or if he can escape<b>,</b> he will always live in anxiety<b>,</b>
        etc<b>..</b> It is to say that he will have eternal and earthly consequences<b>.</b>
        The same thing with <b>a thief:</b> persecuted and despised<b>,</b> in addition
        to his eternal condemnation<b>.</b> <b>The adulterer,</b> besides the eternal
        punishment in hell<b>,</b> will get the betrayed husband's hate<b>,</b> and
        maybe even aggression<b>.</b> <b>The whoremonger</b> will also have an eternal
        condemnation and earthly consequences<b>,</b> like venereal diseases<b>.</b> No
        more examples are necessary in order to demonstrate that the punishment of sins
        has two phases<b>:</b> earthly and eternal<b>.</b> <b>But remember, God is
            just; He won't fail to punish wrongdoings nor to reward good deeds.</b></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Now,
        let's apply all this knowledge, taking into consideration life after death.</b>
        Those who love God will eternally live without suffering<b>.</b> Therefore<b>,</b>
        where will they receive the chastisement for their sins<b>?</b> Only in this
        present life<b>.</b> God won't permit his debts to pass over after death<b>.</b>
        <b>The retribution for all sins that a Christian committed, commits, and will
            commit, has to be done here, in this life.</b> That's why to the pro-God people
        <b>happeneth according to the work of the wicked.</b> They have to pay at least
        a percentage of what they have done<b>.</b></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Just
        the contrary happens to the anti-God people. All of their good deeds have to be
        rewarded here, in this very life.</b> God won't permit that their good deeds
        are not rewarded now<b>,</b> because after death they will receive nothing<b>.</b>
        <b>That is why there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work
            of the righteous. </b></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Also,
        there are wicked men that work in favor of God's will,</b> for some reason or
        another<b>.</b> God rewards those people now<b>,</b> in this life<b>.</b> A
        good biblical example is found in Ezk 29<b>:</b> 17-20 where we see God
        rewarding Nebuchadrezzar for his effort in destroying Tyrus<b>.</b> Another
        good example is in Second Kings 10<b>:</b> 28-31<b>,</b> where we see that God
        rewards Jehu even though the context clearly tells us that he was not a pro-God
        man<b>.</b></p>

        reason not to punish or reward immediately and evidently</b> what the creatures

    <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&nbsp; &nbsp;In this way<b>,</b>

            it is good that doubt remains about if God really punishes or not.</b> Because
        human beings always tend to believe what they like<b>,</b> in that way those
        who believe in Jesus are those who wish that God had provided a system of
        salvation only dependent of Himself that helps us to change our evil feelings
        and desires<b>.</b> On the contrary<b>,</b> those who want to save themselves<b>,</b>
        because they do not want their evil feelings and desires to be changed<b>,</b>
        won't believe in Jesus<b>.</b></p>

        though it is true that immediate and evident reward or punishment is very rare,</b>
        it is my personal experience in the 51 years I have lived<b>,</b> after having
        lived an intense public and private life<b>,</b> and having observed the events
        in which I was actor or observer<b>,</b> that <b>God never ever forsakes his
            own.</b> He punishes and rebukes them<b>,</b> to provoke them to think<b>,</b>
        to abandon their evil deeds or thoughts<b>,</b> but after the person repents

        Another reason why prosperity and success exists in anti-God lives,</b> is that
        they endeavor to reach their goals<b>.</b> If a person sets bricks<b>,</b> he
        builds a wall<b>;</b> it does not matter whether he is good or evil<b>,</b> the
        wall will grow<b>.</b> Why<b>?</b> Because the world is constituted on laws and
        fundamentals that God established<b>.</b> These are immutable<b>,</b> except in
        very few occasions in which a miracle takes place<b>.</b></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>It
        is the same case as if two people, a good one and a bad one, who have climbed
        high up, fall down.</b> The good one is not going to stay floating in the air nor
        fall slowly<b>.</b> Why<b>?</b> Because though it is sad that the good one gets
        hurt<b>,</b> it is also true that <b>before he climbed up there, God had
            already established his immutable law of gravity.</b> If the good one defied
        the law<b>,</b> or he did not have it well into consideration when he performed
        his maneuvers up there<b>,</b> he falls the same way the bad one does<b>.</b> <b>It
            is great haughtiness to expect that God suspend His laws effects in honor of
            our stupidity, stubbornness, arrogance, carelessness, lack of obedience to the
            preexisting rules, or even our sin.</b> To do so would spoil creatures<b>,</b>
        they would get use to being foolish<b>,</b> careless<b>,</b> arrogant<b>,</b>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>He
        who endeavors and uses the established rules in a smart way, will get to his

    <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; The crook is

        see that he has reached his goal<b>,</b> and so they assume that he must be
        happy<b>;</b> but is not<b>.</b> The same way that physical laws<b>,</b>
        established by God<b>,</b> exist<b>,</b> which cannot be violated by good or
        bad people without suffering<b>,</b> there are also spiritual laws that God has
        established<b>,</b> which cannot be violated by good or bad people without
        suffering<b>.</b> <b>Just as the good and the bad fall down, nobody who departs
            from God's established spiritual laws to live a life or reach his goal will be
            happy there.</b> These are also immutable laws<b>.</b> Just because you cannot
        see the spiritual laws<b>,</b> does not mean that they do not exist<b>,</b> or
        that you are not going to feel its power<b>;</b> you neither see gravity<b>,</b>
        but you feel its power<b>.</b></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>A
        man, who did not know the existence of gravity, and another, who heard about it

        but they did not recognize that it was the law of gravity<b>;</b> they said
        that they just fell<b>.</b> Their poor intelligence did not allow them to link
        the abstract knowledge of gravity<b>,</b> with the consequences of having
        broken that law<b>.</b></p>

        &nbsp; The same way humankind reacts when they feel unhappy<b>,</b> even
        Christians<b>.</b> <b>They do not want to admit that it is due to the breaking

        If you believe or obey gravity's law <b>only when you are in the air, but not
            when you are in the water,</b> you will not suffer a fall<b>,</b> but you can

        jumping out of a car roof or a truck bed does not have the same consequences<b>.</b>

        Not all that is bad has to happen to anti-God people, nor all that is good has
        to happen to the pro-God. It depends on what laws each one breaks or obeys. If
        you throw rocks up,</b> don't say later that God broke your head<b>,</b> or
        that it is a mystery the fact that your head was broken<b>,</b> or that God is
        testing you by means of breaking your head<b>.</b> You and only you are to be
        blamed for doing against what is established<b>.</b> Because not every rock

        of he who throws it up<b>,</b> very few people would dare to do it<b>.</b> If
        so<b>,</b> we would never know who is bad enough to throw rocks up when he
        knows that he is not going to get hurt<b>.</b></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>God
        knows what He does. He has everything under control.</b> His laws have a
        certain tolerance<b>,</b> but no one can go farther without suffering its
        consequences<b>.</b> Life and bad deeds function as if we dwell under a high
        and horizontal flat tent<b>,</b> held by four poles<b>.</b> Once in a while the
        dweller puts his hand out and throws a rock on this flat roof<b>,</b> and
        nothing happens<b>.</b> He does it several times<b>,</b> and still nothing
        happens<b>.</b> But when the weight of the rocks that are on the tent's roof
        gets to the limit of tolerance of the tent or the poles<b>,</b> next time<b>,</b>
        when he throws in just a very small rock<b>,</b> or if the wind starts blowing
        a little stronger<b>,</b> all this will cave in on his head<b>.</b> All these
        rocks that we have thrown on the roof<b>,</b> that we thought could be done
        without consequences<b>,</b> fall on our heads<b>.</b> Maybe we can fix the
        tent again and keep dwelling there with more or less fear and anxiety<b>,</b>
        but try not to throw more rocks on the roof<b>,</b> because the tent is already
        deteriorated<b>,</b> and it will be easier to cave in on you again<b>.</b></p>

    <p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp; &nbsp; This is exactly the same way our lives
        function regarding our sins and bad deeds<b>.</b> We keep accumulating them in <b>�</b>some
        place up there<b>�</b> and at any moment they may fall on us<b>.</b> So it is
        wiser for us not to keep sinning<b>,</b> because in the less expected moment
