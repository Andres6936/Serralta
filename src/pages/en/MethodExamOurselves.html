&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Malachi 1: 8 God is giving the Hebrews a method to
test themselves. Nevertheless, this method is good for everyone. With it
we can check whether or not our actions, activities, and feelings, are pleasant
to God or not.
<P>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<I>And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not
evil? And if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? <B> Offer it now
unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person?</B>
saith the LORD of
hosts</I>."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Mal 1: 8 )
<P>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time many of those who brought a lamb or a goat
to be sacrificed in God's Temple, <B> instead of bringing the best they had,
as a demonstration of love</B>, brought a lame, blind, or sick lamb or goat.
People who acted this way did not love God. They offered their sacrifices
probably as a result of peer pressure, social traditions, superstition, or
who knows what.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Prophet Malachi put them in the spot, when he said:
"Offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept
thy person?"</B> Of course, none of them would dare to come to their prince,
governor, or boss, with such animals as a present. Instead, they abused the
patience of God and His kindness. Taking advantage of the fact that God doesn't
strike dead sinners as soon as they sin, they were inflicting such affront
to God and escaping unscathed.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Something similar could be said, now a days, of many
religious people and Christians.</B> They behave with God as they would never
dare to behave with their bosses, or with the V.I.Ps that they need for improving
their position or their business.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, now they do not bring to God lame or blind
lambs, because we do not have sacrifices anymore, but they give God the leftovers
of their time, if any. They pay attention to the daily instructions their
bosses give them. They listen with riveted attention to everything their
bosses want to say, but hardly do they read the instructions their God has
given them in the Bible. <B> If anything, they give God the leftover of their
time</B>. After using lots of time in having fun, watching TV, or earning
money to pay for their funs, then, when they are exhausted, they give some
time to God.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Millions of Christians have never read the Bible from
Genesis to Revelation once</B>, when they should, by this time, have read
it twenty times already. Nevertheless, they never miss reading all business
letters, economy news, or important friends' letters. They always have time
to go to movies, to parties, to watch today's game, or soap opera. Then,
after they are exhausted, they give the leftover of their time to their God,
any at all. Will He be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the
LORD of hosts.
