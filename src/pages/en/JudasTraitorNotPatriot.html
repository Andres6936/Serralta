style='font-size:18.0pt'>NOW THEY WANT TO CONVINCE US THAT JUDAS WAS NOT A
TRAITOR, BUT A PATRIOT.</span></b> </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is
noticeable nowadays a strange endeavor carried out by certain &quot;biblical
scholars&quot; trying to convey in their works, in a very sneaky way, the idea
that Judas Iscariot was not a traitor, but a patriot.&nbsp; The idea seems as
if it came out of a fairy tale book.&nbsp; According to them Judas betrayed
Jesus in order to force him to manifest himself as the Messiah, and to save
Israel from the Romans.&nbsp; It is to say that Judas was an honorable patriot
and not a repugnant traitor. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sadly many Christians swallow such a fantastic
&quot;explanation&quot; of the behavior of that traitor, because they do not
read the Bible, and so they accept any fairy tale they hear. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To start with, let us learn what was John's frame of mind
regarding Judas.&nbsp; <b>Saint John who knew Judas, <u>personally</u> </b>and
had much more information than these &quot;scholars&quot; that now want to
justify him, <b>stated without any hesitation that <u>Judas was a thief</u></b>.
This he said <b>long after these events</b>, after the misunderstandings would
have been cleared up, and passions had settled down. Let's read. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;<i>Then saith one of his disciples, <b>Judas Iscariot</b>, Simon's <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><i>son, which
would betray him:</i> <i>Why was not this ointment <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><i>sold for three
hundred pence, and given to the poor?&nbsp;<b> This <o:p></o:p></b></i></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><b><i>he</i></b> <b><i>said,
<u>not that he cared for the poor</u>; but because <u>he was</u> <u><o:p></o:p></u></i></b></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><b><i><u>a thief</u></i></b><i>,
and had the bag, and</i> <i>bare what was put therein.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:3.0in;
margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'>( John 12: 4 - 6 ) </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>If he was a
thief, then he was not a patriot.</b> Something else to notice is that the
supposed patriot did not care for the poor people of his own country.&nbsp; <b>It
is impossible to conceive a real patriot who does not care for the poor people</b>.&nbsp;
This just is not true. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Another clear fact is that he betrayed Jesus for money.</b>&nbsp;
If he were a patriot he wouldn't stain his hands with money nor with a
betrayal.&nbsp; When he hanged himself it was not because he repented of his
betrayal. He hanged himself because he could not resist the demonic tortures he
was subsequently exposed to.&nbsp; When he was forsaken, given up, deprived of
God's shelter, demons didn't have any restriction, and oppressed him. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Peter sinned heavily when he denied Jesus, but his
repentance was genuine, and was received again.&nbsp; If Judas really repented
he would be forgiven.</b>&nbsp; There is no sin big enough for God's
forgiveness, if there is a genuine repentance. Judas did not repent of what he
did against Jesus, he repented of the demonic consequences that his betrayal
had brought to him. He knew Jesus perfectly well, he knew that Jesus forgave
anyone who repents sincerely. But even so he did not want to ask for
forgiveness. </p>

&quot;<i>Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><i><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>the chief priests, and said</i> <i>unto

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><b><i><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>him for <u>thirty pieces of silver</u>.
And <u>from that time he sought</u></i></b> <br>
<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>opportunity
to betray him</u></i></b>.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(
Mt 26: 14 -16 ) </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we can see in
the former passage, <b>his betrayal was premeditated</b>, having as the only
purpose to get the thirty pieces of silver, but the whole money bag.&nbsp; <b>He
had the opportunity to ponder and consider what he was going to do, and even so
he chose to betray.</b>&nbsp; Not only did he betray Jesus, but in the peak of
his impudence he chose to kiss him as a signal.&nbsp; A man who behaves like
this is not a patriot nor does he believe that Jesus could save his nation from
the Romans.&nbsp; If he had believed it, he would not do what he did. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many years after Judas' betrayal, <b>those who knew him <u>personally</u>
still believed that he was a traitor, a scum, a vile man, a despicable person
and a thief.</b> If Judas had behaved as a patriot these men would not keep
thinking of him that same way so many years later. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John's gospel was written many years after Judas' betrayal.
John, who was better informed about Judas than these <b>questionable
&quot;scholars&quot; who try to justify Judas,</b> says that <b>Judas' betrayal
was the consequence of letting the Devil enter his heart</b>.&nbsp; Those who
really knew about Judas tell us that <b>Judas was not a patriot, but a servant
of Satan</b>.&nbsp; Let us see. </p>

a better testimony than all these</b>.<b>&nbsp; Jesus Christ, who because of
his divinity&nbsp; &quot;knew what was in man&quot;,&nbsp; never justified nor
lessened the gravity of what was done by Judas</b>.&nbsp; On the contrary,
Jesus put a heavy load in the back of&nbsp; the one who betrayed him.&nbsp; In
Matt&nbsp; 26: 24 and Mark&nbsp; 14: 21 Jesus condemned his action, and knowing
the non-repentant condition of Judas' heart, said that it was better for him if
he had never been born. </p>

Jesus <b>personally</b>, as well as the apostles, <b>who <u>really</u> knew first

&quot;scholars&quot; make suspicious efforts to justify him. What are they
planning? Are they trying to soften Christians with the aim to unite them later
with those that admire Judas for his betrayal of Jesus? </p>
