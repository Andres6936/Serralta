    <p align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Christians must not eat from what was sacrificed to
idols<u6:p></u6:p></span></b></p>

    <p style='text-align:justify'>Some brothers have asked me whether Christians
        should or should not eat from food offered to idols, because they think that Paul
        changed the rules, allowing Christians to eat anything, but this is not
        so.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>� </span>In this Bible Note I present the
        biblical bases for believing that <b>to eat what was offered to idols is a sin
            of idolatry</b>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>� </span>It is very important to
        clarify this issue because it is like introducing inadvertently idolatry in the
        Church. Therefore, it is important to present information on this issue. </p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Before starting it is good to
        bring to remembrance some pieces of advice. First, <b>we are Christians, not
            Saintpaulians. </b><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>�</span>Let�s not do with
        <st1:City

            <st1:place w:st="on">Saint Paul</st1:place>
        </st1:City>
        what Catholicism
        did with Virgin Mary. None of them would like to be taken as a vice-Christ.
        <st1:City
                w:st="on">
            <st1:place w:st="on">Saint Paul</st1:place>
        </st1:City>
        was <b><u>one</u></b>
        of the great apostles, <b>not the only one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>�
</span>All other apostles who wrote in the Bible were <u>as inspired as he was</u>.</b><span
                style='mso-spacerun:yes'>� </span>If Paul says something and some other
        apostles or prophets say just the opposite, it is time to understand what Paul
        was trying to say, or in what context he was talking, because <b>the Holy
            Spirit does not contradict himself by inspiring some apostles with something,
            and inspiring Paul with just the opposite.</b></p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Paul was well known for his
        knowledge and wisdom, but also for speaking in a way that not everyone would
        understand.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>� </span>He used to speak with lots
        or hyperboles, and we have to be on the guard about this.<span
                style='mso-spacerun:yes'>� </span><b>Another apostle, <u>also inspired</u> by
            the Holy Spirit</b>, an apostle who was as great as Paul, wrote in II Peter 3:
        15-17 a warning about Paul's way of writing, so that the brethren who read his
        writings do not get confused.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>� </span>Let us see
        what the <b><u>Apostle</u> Peter warns us</b>. </p>

        scriptures, unto their own destruction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>� </span></i><span
            style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>17 </span><i>Ye therefore,
        beloved, seeing ye know these things before<b>, beware <u>lest ye also</u>,

        stedfastness</i>.&quot;<span style='mso-tab-count:4'>��������������������������������������� </span>
        ( II Peter 3: 15-17 ) </p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Saint Peter, inspired by the
        Holy Spirit, warns his brethren to be careful when reading Paul's epistles,
        because they could misunderstand what he says. This is the <b>only warning in
            the whole Bible</b> that an author gives about another author.<span
                style='mso-spacerun:yes'>� </span>Only about Paul was such a warning
        given.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>� </span>I think that such a warning
        should prompt us to be careful as our brother Peter advises us. </p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Those who think that Christians
        are allowed to eat from animals sacrificed to idols base their beliefs on I Co

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><b>If we just read this passage
        from the Bible and not the whole Scripture,</b> we could get confused and think
        that Paul is overriding everybody else's commandments, writings and
        inspirations; including other apostles, prophets, Jesus and even God. If we
        read just this passage we may think that Paul is authorizing us to do what
        others have forbidden us to do. <b>Paul never intended to be &quot;the
            Pope&quot; of Christianity,</b> the self anointed one whose word overrides

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>If we read a little ahead, in I
        Co 10: 14 - 21, we will see that the selfsame Paul, of whom is said that he
        authorized to eat what was sacrificed to idols, says just the opposite. Let us
        read. </p>

    </p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>As we can see, Paul is advising
        that in the same way that <b>sharing the bread and wine makes us one with the
            Lord, also sharing what was sacrificed to de devils, make us one with them.</b>
        He also affirms in verse 21 that we cannot be partakers of the Lord's Table if
        we are partakers of the table of the devils. To clarify, in the very same
        epistle that Paul seems to authorize eating what was sacrificed to the idols,
        he also seems to say just the opposite. Which of Paul's statements should we
        choose to obey, the former or the latter? <b>I think that we should to obey the
            statement that agrees with the whole Bible and with the other apostles. This is
            why it is so good to read the whole Bible without skipping any section</b>, and
        not a little passage here and another little passage there. By reading the
        whole Bible you can find the explanation of an obscure passage in another book
        of the Bible or in another section of the same book, as in this case. </p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Paul is not the only one who
        contradicts his first statement. <b>Other apostles, as good and as inspired as
            Paul, also denied what some people understood from Paul's first statement.</b>
        They said that to eat from what was offered to an idol it to sin. Let us read
        Acts 15: 28-29. </p>

                style='mso-spacerun:yes'>� </span>That alone should give us enough base to deem
        that what Paul seems to say in his first statement ( I Co 8 ), was not what he
        was trying to say, <b>that we should not hold as Christian doctrine that eating
            what was sacrificed to idols is correct</b>. But there is still more. </p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><b>Even Paul himself was

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>If Paul was in that meeting and
        approved what was said, then it is logical to think that what seems to be said
        in I Co 8, has to have another meaning. </p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>But still greater than all that
        I have alleged hitherto, is what verse 28 says<b>: <u>the Holy Ghost himself

            idols</b>. Are more facts and truths needed to prove that <b>Christians should
            not eat from things offered to idols</b>? I think there is enough, but allow me
        to show you two last arguments: let us now see what Jesus himself thinks about
        this. Let us read the letters that the selfsame Jesus Christ sent to the seven

            stumblingblocks before God's servants, <u>teaching them to eat from things
                sacrificed unto idols</u></b>. Is it clear that eating what was sacrificed to
        idols is a sin? Yes! It is Jesus himself who say so! Let us now see what Jesus
        says to the one in charge of the Church at Thyatira. </p>

        few things against thee</i></b><i>, because thou sufferest that woman <b>Jezebel</b>,
        which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to
        commit fornication, and <b>to eat things sacrificed unto idols</b></i>.&quot; <span

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>As we can notice, Jesus called
        the people who taught such doctrines not very nice names: <b>&quot;Jezebel&quot;</b>
        in this verse, and <b>&quot;Balaam&quot;</b> in the former one. Both names
        meaning people who deceived and misled God's servants from Christian
        principles. In both instances <b>Jesus rebukes those who teach that Christians
            can eat from sacrifices to idols</b>. He doesn't talk about a supposedly
        &quot;Christian freedom&quot; to do what each one deems right. <b>Jesus talks
            about what <u>he knows is wrong,</u></b> even if Paul seems to say that it is
        right to do, which he didn't. Remember, we are not Saintpaulians, we are
        Christians. </p>

    <p style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'>Now, if Paul had no authority to
        change the rules, in order to allow Christians to eat things sacrificed to idols,
        then what did me mean? <b>I assume, I cannot prove it, but I think</b> that
        Paul was trying to calm down the anxiety of some Christians from
        <st1:City
                w:st="on">
            <st1:place w:st="on">Corinth</st1:place>
        </st1:City>
        who inadvertently
        had eaten things sacrificed to idols, or who before becoming Christians ate
        such foods. Maybe those brethren were feeling like they were condemned, or like
        having sinned before the Lord. I think so because of the way in which Paul
        speaks to them saying &quot;<i>we know that <b>an idol is nothing</b> in the
            world, and that there is none other God but one</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>for some
            with the conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto
            an idol</i>.&quot; More than likely some Corinth Christians inadvertently
        bought at the butcher's shop, meat that formerly was offered to an idol, and
        after eating such food they thought they had lost their salvation or the like.
        Then Paul, using hyperboles, as he commonly did in his unique way of speaking,
        tried to reassure those brethren. This is what <b>I think</b> Paul was trying
        to say; if someone finds a better explanation please tell me.
