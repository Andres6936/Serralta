<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many who reject the idea that the Biblical
prophecies that announce the fall of stars on Earth, could occur. They deem
it impossible because of their narrow-minded approach that stars are much
bigger than Earth, therefore a rain of stars will be impossible.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clear that the purpose of stars falling on the Earth
is to give a clear and matchless sign of the Coming of the Lord, not to introduce
a new astronomical theory.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<I>Immediately after the tribulation of those days, shall
  the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and <B> the stars
  shall fall from heaven</B>, and the powers of the heavens shall be
  shaken</I>."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( Mtt 24:29 )

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though stars are very big, the common person sees
them as small. They will not be able to tell the difference between a meteorite
and a real star. If several thousands of meteorites the size of an egg, a
fist, or a coconut would fall on our planet, for the common person it is
as if the stars had fallen or at least a great quantity of them. Nevertheless,
the physical impact on our planet will be just as if thousands of small stones
would have fallen on the Earth. <B> Nothing, however, capable of destroying
the planet.</B>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The warnings in the Bible are directed to the common
person, not only for astronomers.</B> It is fulfilling a prophecy for all
mankind. When the sun and the moon darkens, the falling of the stars will
indicate to mankind that the era of their haughtiness is over, and that we
are in the threshold of the Eternal Kingdom of God.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the prophecy arrives, the common person and skeptics
alike will be clear that it isn't an ordinary eclipse or meteor shower. A
fearful rain of meteorites will achieve the goal for what it was prophesied:
it is to warn mankind the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is my opinion that the falling of the stars will be
a great meteor shower. I believe so because of what is written in Rev 8:12.
There it says that when the fourth angel blows the trumpet, there are still
stars in the firmament.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, the purpose of the falling stars is to make
mankind aware that a prophetical sign has been fulfilled. Therefore only
what is enough for that purpose will occur.
