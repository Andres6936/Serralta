<center><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+2>Saying that
Jesus could not be born in December is a lie.</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>It is
false to say that Jesus could not be born in December</b>.&nbsp; Those
who are engaged in putting down Jesus use several tricks. Sadly many brothers
have been taken into these traps. This is written to help those brothers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not
saying that I can prove that Jesus was born in December, however I am saying&nbsp;
that <b>it is a lie that others can prove that Jesus was not born in December</b>.
The month of December can not be excluded, as many "scholars" endeavor
to&nbsp; "prove".&nbsp;&nbsp; This is one of the many lies spread by the
Russellites, wrongly called Jehovah's Witnesses, because they are not.&nbsp;
Sadly many gullible Christians just swallow these lies without thinking.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp;
1998-1999 winter issue of "Life &amp; Work Pursuits", a Christian quarterly,
on page 35, lines 33-35 it says:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>"</i>The
Bible does not indicate the time of year Jesus was born. <u>Most likely,
since</u></b></font>
<br><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>shepherds were in the field, his birth was in spring</u><i>.</i>"</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On what
basis is it said Jesus was not born in December as tradition states?&nbsp;
Is there any proof ? No, they are just repeating what someone else invented.
<b>Tradition
should be rejected when it opposes what the Bible teaches</b>,<b> the facts
or the logic&nbsp;</b> but not just because someone else tells us to reject
it.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mohammed's
Hegira</b> occurred on Friday July 16, 622 AD, according to tradition.
No one disputes it, because this tradition does not contradict facts or
logic. <b>Buddha,</b> according to tradition, lived from 563 to 483 BC,
nobody says any thing contrary to such tradition, they just simply believe
it. <b>There are hundreds of traditions that are accepted.</b>&nbsp; Why
not accept the tradition that Jesus was born December 25th?&nbsp; It does
not harm anybody. It does not oppose any fact. It does not oppose logic.
<b>It
does not oppose the Bible.</b> Then, again, why do they go to such great
lengths to oppose it ? <b>Because everything that has to do with Jesus
prompts the opposition of God's enemies.</b></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Russellists
say that Jesus <u>couldn't</u> be born in December because <u>the fields
were covered with snow</u> at that time.&nbsp; <u>That is a big lie</u>.</b>
Jesus' enemies take advantage of the ignorance of others to spread their
lies. Israel is a long narrow country that extends along 390 miles from
North to South.&nbsp; You can verify the data I state here in the Encyclopedia.&nbsp;
The World Book Encyclopedia, copyright 1974, volume 10, page 390, when
describing the climate of Israel says:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>"In January,
the coolest month</b>,<b> temperatures average 45&ordm; F ( 7&ordm; C )
in Northern Galilee, and 60&ordm; F ( 16&ordm; C ) in the Rift Valley.</b>
The Northern uplands have some days of freezing weather
<b>almost </b>every
winter.&nbsp; Rain falls almost entirely in winter, and generally decreases
from North to South. <b>Snow <u>sometimes</u> falls in Northern and central
parts of Israel.</b>"</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As stated,
January is the coolest month, not December. In the coolest month temperatures
average 45&ordm; F ( 7&ordm; C ) just in the North. That temperature is
not so cold that the shepherds can't stay outside. But more to the South,
it averages 60&ordm; F ( 16&ordm; C ), still a more comfortable temperature
even in January the coolest month. <b>Therefore, December must be even
warmer</b>, because January is the coolest month.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Only
in the Northern uplands</b> do freezing temperatures occur <b><u>some</u>
days</b>, not every single year, but <b>almost</b> every winter. Regarding
snow it says that sometimes, ( not every year), snow falls in the Northern
and central parts of Israel. <b>Not in the South where Bethlehem is located.</b></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we now
go to volume 11, page 77, of the same encyclopedia we see that the temperature
<b>in
Jerusalem, in January, which is the coolest month, average 55&ordm; F (
13&ordm; C).&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Logically, December has to have a warmer temperature.
Since Bethlehem is located about five miles South of Jerusalem (volume
2, page 214) it must have the same temperature.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What wisdom
is there in saying that the shepherds could not be in the field in December?
<b>Where is that field "full of snow" that Russellists are always saying
that existed?&nbsp; Why do Christians have to be so gullible with falsehoods?</b>&nbsp;
I can not prove that Jesus was born in December, but that is what tradition
says, and neither the Bible nor logic oppose to this tradition. <b>Why
then is it so fiercely attacked</b>?&nbsp; Because they want to destroy
Christianity from the inside out.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Let us
<u>suppose</u>
that Bethlehem did have such cold winters.&nbsp; </b>Padanaram, the region
Rebekah was from, is located much more to the North than Bethlehem,&nbsp;
where it is much&nbsp; colder.<b>&nbsp; Let us see if the shepherds over
there stayed with their cattle on winter nights.</b></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a problem
arose between Jacob and Esau, Rebekah convinced Isaac to send Jacob to
Padamaram for awhile.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<i>And
Isaac sent away Jacob: and <u>he went to Padanaram
</u>unto Laban, son
of Bethuel</i></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother</i>."&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Gn 28: 5)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jacob stayed
there for twenty years tending Laban's cattle. When he left he had an argument
with Laban, his father-in-law, to whom he said:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"</b><i><font size=-2>38 </font>This twenty years have I been with thee;
thy ewes and thy she goats have</i></font>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten. 39 That
which was</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
torn of&nbsp; beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of
my hand didst thou</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night. 40 Thus I was; in
the day the</font></i>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from
mine eyes</i><b>."</b></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Gn 31: 38- 40 )</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From
the words of Jacob we understand that <b>even during extremely cold nights
he stayed with the cattle in the field.&nbsp;</b> And this happened for
twenty years.&nbsp; Jacob says he used to do what Russellists say Bethlehem
shepherds could not have done. And remember that this was not in Bethlehem
with the temperature of just 60&ordm; F, ( 16&ordm; C) but it was up North,
in a much colder climate. Therefore, it is not illogical that in Bethlehem
the shepherds stayed in the fields at night in December.&nbsp; So it was
not such a "difficult thing" for shepherds to stay with their cattle in
the fields of Bethelehem even in cold winters.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Another
pseudo argument that is used to discredit Christmas, is saying that formerly
it was the winter solstice pagan feast.</b>&nbsp; This is also false.&nbsp;
Christmas is on December 25th, while the winter solstice occur from the
21st to 22nd of December.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>It
is clear that all they want to do is to find fault</b> so as to make Christians
think that they are celebrating on a wrong date or welcoming a pagan feast.&nbsp;
There have been hundreds of pagan countries through history, therefore
there are thousands of pagan feasts.&nbsp; Every day of the year is the
anniversary of some pagan feast.&nbsp; If it is not a feast of ancient
Greeks, it is a feast of ancient Mayas, Aztecs, Incas, Chinese, Persians,
Celts, Romans, etc., etc..</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If tradition, instead of celebrating Christ's birth on December 25th, they
would celebrate it on any other day, they would also find some other pagan
feast with which to smear and discredit it.&nbsp; What really hurts them
is that even nominal Christians recognize Jesus' name.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>It
is sad brethren who go to seminaries to learn how to serve our Lord let
themselves&nbsp; be cheated and be led astray by those who plot the "dischristianization"
of Christendom.</b></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The "proof " that Jesus was not born in December, that Russellists and
others try to hammer into the minds of many Christians, is not proof at
all, <b>it is just a lie</b>.</font>
