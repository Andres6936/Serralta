<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>God
doesn't allow trials in a person's life in order to know how that person would
respond, but to let others know.</span> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are those who think that trying a person serves the
purpose of informing God how that person is going to respond in certain
circumstances. This is not so. God uses trials to inform others of how a person
will respond to a situation. The best case study is Job. <b>This man was not
tried to inform God how Job would respond, but to demonstrate to Satan that
there were people who were loyal and faithful to God; even though enduring the
hardest trials would never depart from God.</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Satan is&nbsp; a creature that even though he had
greatness and privileges, he deserted the Lord God because he wanted even more.
Now, God, who knew perfectly well how Job was going to respond, allowed his
trying to go on.&nbsp; As we see in verse 8, <b>God considered Job a faithful
upright servant, who feared God, and departed from sin</b>. If God thought like
this about Job, it is evident that He didn't need to try him in order to know
how Job was. On the contrary, God was using Job to teach Satan a lesson; to
demonstrate to him how a being of lower level, a creature who was less than an
angel, was far more loyal and faithful than Satan himself. Even though Job was
mistreated, he was far more faithful than many creatures, especially far more
than Satan. It was the greatest honor for Job to be chosen by God as an example
to Satan. The trials were most rough on him, but the honor of having served God
for this purpose was also the greatest reward for a man. </p>

style='font-size:7.5pt'>6 </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Now
there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the
LORD, and Satan came also among them. </i><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span

thou considered <u>my servant Job</u>, that&nbsp; <u>there is none like him in

God</u>, and <u>escheweth evil</u>?</b>&nbsp; </i><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-size:7.5pt'>11 </span>But
put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to
thy face. </i><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-size:
7.5pt'>12 </span>And the LORD said unto Satan: Behold, all that he hath is in
thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from
the presence of the LORD</i>.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
style='mso-tab-count:3'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Job 1: 6-12 ) </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>God never needs to put a person to the test in order
to know him.</b> He knows how each person is going to react or behave. When He
puts someone to the test, it is to show others how this &quot;someone&quot; is
going to behave or react when confronted with a special situation. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Some brothers mistakenly call &quot;tests and
trials&quot; to things that are the logical consequences of their sins and
mistakes.</b> They are not being tested or tried, they are suffering for their
mistakes and sins. God is not trying these brothers, they are too weak, and may
be broken if tried. God only permits trials on people like Job, because He
knows those who are not going to let Him down.&nbsp; Before believing you are
&quot;tried&quot;, think if you are <b>a&nbsp; perfect, upright man, who fears
God, and eschews evil.</b> </p>
