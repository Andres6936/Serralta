<p>Women and the veil in Biblical times</p>
<p> There exists very often among Christians the error of confusing Muslim customs with the customs of Biblical
    times<strong>.</strong> Many believe<strong>,</strong> including some scholars and professors of seminaries that
    women in Biblical times lived with their faces covered by a veil like the Muslim women of today<strong>.</strong>
    There is no such thing<strong>.</strong> As a nuptial custom<strong>,</strong> a woman used a veil to present
    herself before the man who she was going to marry<strong>,</strong> but that was only for that
    purpose<strong>,</strong> the rest of her activities and life<strong>,</strong> she walked around with her face
    uncovered<strong>.</strong> Nowadays a bride also uses a veil during the marriage ceremony<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> Decent women did not have to cover their faces<strong>,</strong> the ones that covered their faces were the
    prostitutes<strong>,</strong> as we can see in the passage I present below<strong>,</strong> in which Judah upon
    seeing his daughter in law Thamar<strong>,</strong> thought she was a prostitute because she had a veil covering her
    face<strong>.</strong> Even it says that the reason why he thought she was a prostitute was because she was
    covered<strong>.</strong> If all the women of that time would have been used to wearing a veil over their
    faces<strong>,</strong> Judah would not have thought that a woman who he saw with a veil covering her face was a
    prostitute<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong>14 And she put her widow's garments off from her<strong>,</strong> and covered her with a
    vail<strong>,</strong> and wrapped herself<strong>,</strong> and sat in an open place<strong>,</strong> which is by
    the way to Timnath<strong>;</strong> for she saw that Shelah was grown<strong>,</strong> and she was not given unto
    him to wife<strong>.</strong> 15 When Judah saw her<strong>,</strong> he thought her to be an
    harlot<strong>,</strong> because she had covered her face<strong>."</strong></p>
<p> (Genesis 38<strong>:</strong>14-15)</p>
<p></p>
<p> From the reading of these two previous verses<strong>,</strong> it is evident that decent women did not walk around
    with their faces covered<strong>,</strong> but the prostitutes<strong>.</strong> The error of many is that they
    confuse Biblical customs with Muslim customs<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> This same idea is perceived in Genesis 24<strong>:</strong>65 where it shows that Rebecca walked around without a
    veil in front of Abraham's servant and the ten men under his keep<strong>.</strong> Rebecca only put the veil on
    when she saw that Isaac<strong>,</strong> her future husband was coming to meet with her<strong>.</strong> If
    Rebecca had always used a veil<strong>,</strong> she would not have had to put it on when Abraham's servant told her
    that her fiancï¿½e was coming to her<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong>For she had said unto the servant<strong>:</strong> What man is this that walketh in the field to
    meet us<strong>?</strong> And the servant had said<strong>:</strong> It is my master<strong>.</strong> Therefore she
    took a veil<strong>,</strong> and covered herself<strong>."</strong> (Gn 24<strong>:</strong>65)</p>
<p></p>
<p> It is clearly seen that Rebecca was not wearing a veil in front of Abraham's servant<strong>,</strong> and therefore<strong>,</strong>
    in front of all the men who were in the retinue<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> Further along<strong>,</strong> in Genesis 29<strong>:</strong>17 it says that Rachel (Rebecca's niece) had a
    beautiful face<strong>.</strong> That does not give us a very wide margin to think that it was hidden under a
    veil<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> In addition<strong>,</strong> I do not remember any passage which may lead us to think that the women in the Middle
    East <strong>at that time,</strong> covered their faces with a veil<strong>.</strong> That came after the Muslims
    imposed with blood and fire their religion and their customs to that area<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong>Leah was tender eyed<strong>;</strong> but Rachel was beautiful and well
    favoured<strong>."</strong> (Gensis 29<strong>:</strong>17)</p>
<p></p>
<p> If Rachel's pretty face could be appreciated<strong>,</strong> it is because she did not wear a
    veil<strong>,</strong> because hidden behind a veil<strong>,</strong> all faces are the same<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> To interpret the Bible correctly<strong>,</strong> it is good to know ancient customs<strong>,</strong> but
    throughout the Bible<strong>,</strong> not books written by confused authors<strong>.</strong></p>
