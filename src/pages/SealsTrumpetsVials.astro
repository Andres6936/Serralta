        <p><strong>REVELATION: THE PERIODS OF SEALS, TRUMPETS AND VIALS ARE NOT CONTEMPORARY IN ALL THEIR
            EXTENSIONS.</strong>
        </p>
        <p> I have heard some brethren say that the seals, trumpets and vials of Revelation are three different symbols
            which
            represent the same periods of the last days. It is to say, that according to their interpretation, the
            fourth seal,
            for example, represents the same period represented by the fourth trumpet and the fourth vial, but depicting
            other
            details in each one. I am do not agree with this interpretation. <strong>The first six seals are opened and
                no
                trumpet has been heard yet, nor any vial has been poured out either. The seventh seal is what triggers
                the
                beginning of the sounding of the trumpets</strong>. By the same token, <strong>the first six trumpets
                have been
                heard, but still no vial has been poured out yet.</strong> It is after the sounding of the seventh
            trumpet that
            the pouring out of the seven vials begins. In general, we see that the seventh period of each symbol
            includes the
            seven periods of the next symbol. I am going to show a numeric example and a graphic example, to try to
            explain how
            I think the periods represented by these symbols are going to appear. After I have explained what I think, I
            will
            show the biblical basis that backs my interpretation. During the period of the seventh seal the seven
            trumpets are
            heard; and during the period of the seventh trumpet, the seven vials are poured out. It is as if the seven
            trumpets
            are a detailed account of the events that will occur during the seventh seal period; and the seven vials are
            a
            detailed account of the events to occur during the seventh trumpet period. <strong>These periods are
                different in
                duration,</strong> but in order to make my explanation easier let's suppose that the seven periods
            corresponding
            to the same type of symbol are of the same duration. Let's suppose that each one of the seven seals, just
            for the
            sake of using an easy number to handle, are going to last 49 days, <strong>not because I think that this is
                going to
                be the real time they will last.</strong> Let's also suppose that each trumpet will last 7 days, and
            that each
            vial will last one day. All together, the seals, trumpets, and vials, are going to last 343 days. Remember
            that this
            is just an example for didactic motives. If we admit these durations then:</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>the first seal period will last from day 1 to day 49 the second seal period will last from day 50 to day 98
            the third
            seal period will last from day 99 to day 147 the fourth seal period will last from day 148 to day 196 the
            fifth seal
            period will last from day 197 to day 245 the sixth seal period will last from day 246 to day 294 the seventh
            seal
            period will last from day 295 to day 343</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>After the seventh seal is opened, during the period it represents, the period of the sounding of the
            seven
            trumpets will begin</strong>. Therefore, continuing with this hypothetical example of the numbers, the
            trumpets
            periods would last in the following way:</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>the first trumpet period will last from day 297 to day 301 the second trumpet period will last from day 302
            to day
            308 the third trumpet period will last from day 309 to day 315 the fourth trumpet period will last from day
            316 to
            day 322 the fifth trumpet period will last from day 323 to day 329 the sixth trumpet period will last from
            day 330
            to day 336 the seventh trumpet period will last from day 337 to day 343</p>
        <p></p>
        <p> I started, on purpose, the period of the first trumpet on day 297 instead of 295 because I wanted to
            emphasize that
            <strong>the first trumpet does not have to be heard immediately after the opening of the seventh
                seal</strong>, but
            at anytime after its opening. Continuing with this numerical example we will see that the first vial would
            be poured
            out at any moment of the 337 day, after the sounding of the seventh trumpet. I think that all this will
            happen in
            rapid succession, but let's keep using our numerical example. So, the vials would be poured out on the
            following
            days:</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>the first vial would be poured out on day 337 the second vial would be poured out on day 338 the third vial
            would be
            poured out on day 339 the fourth vial would be poured out on day 340 the fifth vial would be poured out on
            day 341
            the sixth vial would be poured out on day 342 the seventh vial would be poured out on day 343</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>I want to remind again, that I am not saying that these periods are going to last what the example
            says</strong>. I repeat this because I am afraid that someone could start saying that I said that the seals
            are
            going to last 49 days, etc.. As an example we can say that the third trumpet could last more (or less) than
            the
            fifth seal. What can be said for sure is that the <strong>seventh period</strong> of a type of symbol
            includes the
            <strong>seven periods</strong> of the next type. If I had to express this idea graphically, I would do it
            with the
            following graph.</p>
        <p><img alt="SellosTrompetasCopas" height="255" src="SellosTrompetasCopas.jpg" width="492"></p>
        <p> As we can see in the numeric example, "day 343" belongs to the seventh seal, ( days 295 to 343 ), to the
            seventh
            trumpet, ( days 337 to 343 ), and to the seventh vial ( day 343 ). By the same token, in the graphic
            example,
            <strong>the last portion</strong> of the seventh seal, <strong>the last portion</strong> of the seventh
            trumpet and
            <strong>all of the</strong> seventh vial, are concomitant. <strong>This explains why the seventh seal, the
                seventh
                trumpet and the seventh vial finish in the epoch of the Second Coming of the Lord and the destruction of
                the
                antiChrist, and all three contain elements of the end of times.</strong> Of course, all this is just a
            theory
            with the same authority or lack of authority than the one elaborated by anyone else. Anyways, the most
            brainy
            elaborated theories could be rendered obsolete by a new and more logical theory or by the implacable
            reality.
            <strong>Observing the first four seals we are led to think in the possibility that some of these periods do
                not have
                to end when the next starts. Rather, their starting points are successive, but because of their total
                duration,
                they are partially contemporaneous.</strong> For example, the second seal, seems to be the war, the
            third one
            the famine, and the fourth the death. I don't think that first there will be a period of war, then after the
            period
            of war, a period of peace, and then the period of famine will begin, and when finished, a period of
            abundance, and
            then the period of death. The starting points of these three periods are successive, in sequential dates,
            but the
            duration of them are such that they last till after the beginning of the next period, and even well into it,
            or
            more. Therefore, there will be, at the same time, war, famine and death. Maybe the deaths will be caused by
            plagues
            that will be un unleashed in the future. The consequences of the opening of these seals will last into the
            fourth
            seal. If someone has a better interpretation and can substantiate it with proofs or reasoning, please let me
            know,
            because I love to learn from my mistakes. Let me now explain what are the basis for my interpretation.
            <strong>First
                argument.</strong> <strong>According to Rev 8: 1-2 the seven angels receive their trumpets after Jesus
                Christ
                opens the seventh seal.</strong> It is easy to realize that previous to the opening of the seventh seal
            nobody
            had a trumpet to sound. Therefore, the periods represented by the trumpets cannot be contemporaneous with,
            nor
            equivalent to, the periods represented by the seals.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p> "<i>And <strong>when he had opened the seventh seal,</strong> there was silence in heaven about the
            space</i> <i> of
            half an hour. And <strong>I saw the seven angels</strong> which stood before God; and <strong>to them were
                given</strong></i> <strong> seven trumpets</strong>." ( Rev 8: 1-3 )</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>The second argument</strong> <strong>is that the seals are opened by the Lamb, and no one else was
            considered
            worthy to open them</strong>, as is stated in Rev 5: 2-5. Therefore, it is not logical to think that if the
            trumpets
            and the vials supposedly are the samething than the seals, these two last ones were handled by just angels,
            and not
            by the Lamb Himself as was the case of the seals.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p> "1 <i>And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the</i></p>
        <p><i>�throne a book written within and</i> <i>on the backside, <strong>sealed</strong></i></p>
        <p><strong>with</strong> <strong>seven seals.</strong> 2 <i>And I saw a strong angel proclaiming</i></p>
        <p><i>with</i> <i>a loud voice,<strong>Who</strong> <strong>is worthy</strong> to open the book, and
            <strong>to</strong></i>
        </p>
        <p><strong>loose</strong> <strong>the seals thereof? ……</strong> 5 <i>And one of the elders saith</i></p>
        <p><i>unto</i> <i>me, Weep not: behold, <strong>the Lion of the tribe of Juda,</strong></i> <strong> the Root of
            David,
            hath prevailed to open the book, and</strong></p>
        <p><strong>�to loose the seven seals</strong> <strong>thereof</strong><strong>.</strong> 6 <i>And I beheld, and,<strong>…..</strong></i>
        </p>
        <p><strong>stood</strong> <strong>a Lamb as it had been slain ……</strong> 7 <i>And he came and</i></p>
        <p><i>took</i> <i>the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the</i></p>
        <p><i>�throne<strong>……</strong></i>9 <i>And they sung a</i> <i>new song, saying, <strong>Thou art</strong></i>
        </p>
        <p><strong>worthy</strong> <strong>to take the book, and to open the seals thereof:</strong></p>
        <p><i>for</i> <i>thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy</i></p>
        <p><i>blood</i><i>, out of every kindred, and tonge, and people and</i></p>
        <p><i>nation</i><i>"�����������������������������������</i> ( Rev� 5: 1-9 abbreviated )</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>For the third argument</strong> we must remember that <strong>"the harvest" represents the gathering
            of the
            Christians.</strong> Then we must consider that in the last verses of chapter 14, <strong>Jesus reaps the
            harvest</strong>, and that <strong>following the reaping</strong> the angels work in the gathering of the
            grapes of
            the wrath of God, for which in 15: 1 seven angels have the seven vials with the seven last plagues. So, it
            is
            evident that Jesus came in the seventh and last trumpet, and after that, the angels receive the vials.
            <strong>Therefore,
                the seven vials will be poured out after the seventh trumpet.</strong></p>
        <p></p>
        <p> "14 <i>And I looked, <strong>and behold a white cloud, and upon the</strong></i></p>
        <p><strong>cloud</strong> <strong>one sat like unto</strong> <strong>the Son of man,</strong> <i>having on his
            head</i>
        </p>
        <p><i>�a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.</i> 15 <i>And</i></p>
        <p><i>another</i> <i>angel came out of the temple, <strong>crying with a loud</strong></i></p>
        <p><strong>�voice to him that sat</strong> <strong>on the cloud: Thrust in thy sickle, and</strong></p>
        <p><strong>�reap, for the time is come for thee to reap;</strong> <strong>for the harvest</strong> <i>of</i></p>
        <p><i>�the Earth is ripe.</i> 16 <i>And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his</i></p>
        <p><i>�sickle</i> <i>on the Earth; and the earth was reaped.</i> 17 <strong>And another</strong></p>
        <p><strong>�angel came out of the temple</strong> <i>which is in heaven, he also</i></p>
        <p><i>having</i> <i>a</i> <i>sharp sickle.</i> 18 <i>And another angel came out from the</i></p>
        <p><i>altar</i><i>, which had power over fire;</i> <i>and cried with a loud cry to</i></p>
        <p><i>�him that had the sharp sickle, saying: Thrust in thy sharp</i> <i> sickle, and gather <strong>the
            clusters of the
            vine</strong> of the Earth; for</i></p>
        <p><i>her</i> <i>grapes are fully ripe.</i> 19 <strong>And the angel thrust in his sickle</strong></p>
        <p><strong>�into the Earth, and gathered the vine of the</strong> <strong>Earth, and cast</strong></p>
        <p><strong>it</strong> <strong>into the great winepress of the wrath of God.</strong> 20 <i>And the</i></p>
        <p><i>winepress</i> <i>was trodden without the city, and blood came out</i></p>
        <p><i>�of the winepress, even unto the horse</i> <i>bridles, by the space of</i></p>
        <p><i>�a thousand and six hundred furlongs.</i></p>
        <p><i> </i> 15: 1 <i>And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous,</i></p>
        <p><i>�<strong>seven</strong> <strong>angels having</strong></i> <strong>the seven last plagues</strong><i>; for
            in them
            is</i></p>
        <p><i>filled</i> <i>up the wrath of God</i>." ( Rev 14: 14 to 15: 1 )</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>These three arguments show that evidently the seals, trumpets, and vials are all symbols that
            represent
            completely different periods</strong>. It is also noticeable that even the beginning of the first period of
            each
            symbol are not contemporaneous, the last period of all of them are concomitant. It is to say that the
            seventh seal,
            the seventh trumpet and the seventh vial are partially contemporaneous.</p>
