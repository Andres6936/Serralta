                <p><strong>Index of Biblical Notes in English</strong></p>

                <p> These Bible Notes are useful to understand some themes that God's enemies have tried to twist, or
                    themes that are
                    difficult to interpret. It is beneficial to read them. You can use all the material in here to help
                    others,
                    especially to help members of your church. <strong>We are going to add new Bible Notes as often as
                        possible;
                        therefore visit us frequently</strong>. <strong>If you think I have a mistake in a Biblical
                        Note</strong>,
                    please, send me your opinion and the arguments that can back it up. I will appreciate it very much.
                    I also like to
                    learn from others. Also if you would like some special issue to be addressed in a Biblical Note,
