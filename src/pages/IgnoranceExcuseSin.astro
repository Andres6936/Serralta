    <section>
<p><strong>Ignorance of God's Law is no excuse to sin against God. The servant who ignored the will of his lord will be
    flogged with few stripes, but will be flogged</strong></p>
<p> When we read Lv 4<strong>:</strong>13 we realize that even if one person ignores the commission of a
    sin<strong>,</strong> it doesn't mean he is not guilty<strong>.</strong> In other words<strong>,</strong> if a
    person sins without knowing it is a sin<strong>,</strong> even so he is guilty<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong><i>And if the whole congregation of Israel <strong>sin through ignorance,</strong> <strong>and the
    thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly,</strong> and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of
    the LORD concerning things which should not be done<strong>,</strong> <strong>and are
        guilty</strong></i><strong>"</strong> (Lev 4<strong>:</strong>13)</p>
<p> Whether or not someone is conscious that what he does was a sin<strong>,</strong> if the act he committed was sinful
    he will be guilty<strong>.</strong> As we can see<strong>,</strong> the excuse of ignorance does not exist for
    sin<strong>.</strong> <strong>Our responsibility is to inquire, to seek the Supreme Being and find out if somehow,
        even if by feeling after him, as Paul said, we find Him.</strong> Our obligation is to inquire about His
    laws<strong>,</strong> to find out about the rules before we act<strong>.</strong> <strong>If by giving little
        importance to God and his rules,</strong> we do not inquire about them<strong>,</strong> we do not know
    them<strong>,</strong> and we act against them<strong>,</strong> that is our problem<strong>.</strong> That same
    idea is expressed in Leviticus 4<strong>:</strong>27-28 and 5<strong>:</strong>17<strong>.</strong> Let's
    see<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong><i>And if any one of the common people <strong>sin through ignorance,</strong> while he doeth
    somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done<strong>,</strong>
    and <strong>be guilty</strong></i><strong>"</strong> (Lev 4<strong>:</strong>27)</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong><i>And <strong>if a soul sin, and commit any of these things</strong> which are forbidden to be
    done by the commandments of the LORD<strong>;</strong> <strong>though he wist it not, yet is he guilty,</strong> and
    <strong>shall bear his iniquity</strong></i><strong>".</strong> (Lev 5<strong>:</strong>17)</p>
<p> It is actually true that someone who is ignorant <strong>in good faith</strong> has a certain extenuating
    circumstances<strong>,</strong> but never absolving<strong>.</strong> This is proven in Luke 12<strong>:</strong>47-48
    when the Lord Jesus himself says that the servant who did not understand<strong>,</strong> and because of his
    ignorance did things worthy of stripes<strong>,</strong> <strong>will be striped less.</strong> In other
    words<strong>,</strong> the one who knew he was doing wrong and continued doing so<strong>,</strong> will receive
    many stripes<strong>,</strong> while the one who sincerely did not know<strong>,</strong> <strong>will receive less
        stripes,</strong> not as many as the one who did know<strong>;</strong> <strong>but he will be striped.</strong>
    We can see clearly that ignorance is extenuating but not absolving<strong>.</strong> (Extenuating means it lessens
    the punishment<strong>;</strong> absolving means it totally annuls it<strong>.</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>"</strong>47 <i>And <strong>that servant, which knew his lord's will,</strong> and prepared not
    himself<strong>,</strong> neither did according to his will<strong>,</strong> <strong>shall be beaten with many
        stripes.</strong></i> 48 <i>But <strong>he that knew not,</strong> and did commit things worthy of
    stripes<strong>,</strong> <strong>shall be beaten with few stripes.</strong> For unto whomsoever much is
    given<strong>,</strong> of him shall be much required<strong>,</strong> and to whom men have committed
    much<strong>,</strong> of him they will ask the more</i><strong>".</strong> (Lk 12<strong>:</strong>47-48)</p>
<p><strong>In short,</strong> good faith ignorance of God's commandments <strong>does not</strong> free anyone from the
    penalty of transgression<strong>,</strong> the most it lessen that penalty<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> Let it then be known to the nonbelievers<strong>,</strong> who try not learning about God so they can allege
    ignorance<strong>,</strong> as well as the believers that do not want to inquire much about whether or not to obey
    God's commandments<strong>,</strong> hoping to allege good faith ignorance<strong>.</strong></p>
