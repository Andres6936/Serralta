    <title>Why Cain's offering was not acceptable</title>

<p><strong>Why Cain's offering was not acceptable</strong></p>
<p><strong>There are those who think that Cain's offering was not acceptable because it was not a blood offering. Others
    think that it was not acceptable because it was a vegetable plant offering.</strong> However, many types of
    offerings were considered acceptable, and not all of them were blood offerings, consequently, I think that there was
    not a special rejection from God of offerings in which blood was not present.</p>
<p>This reasoning can also be applied to the second supposition, which affirms that Cain's offering was not acceptable
    because it was the product of plants and not of animals. <strong>One of the offerings of the day of Pentecost and
        first fruits offerings was wheat grain</strong>. Therefore, there was nothing against these kinds of offerings.
</p>
<p><strong>According to the narration in Gn 4: 3-5 we get the idea that Cain's problem was a lack of love and respect
    for the Lord God.</strong> When Abel's offering is described the focus is in the lovely way in which he chose an
    offering for God. <strong>He chose the best he could find,</strong> he brought the firstlings of his flock and the
    fat thereof. <strong>This tells us that he had great respect for God</strong> and that he loved Him enough to give
    Him the best, instead of keeping it for himself.</p>
<p><strong>The attitude of Cain was just the opposite. He didn't chose the best,</strong> he just grabbed anything; as a
    person who wants to fulfill an obligation. He didn't look for the best of his crop; he thought that anything was
    good enough for God. <strong>His attitude was not that of a man who has the offering recipient in great esteem,
        respect, and love</strong>. This is why his offering was not worthy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"<i>And in process of time it came to pass, that <strong>Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering</strong>
    unto the LORD. And Abel, he also <strong>brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof.</strong> And
    the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering, but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain
    was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</i>" ( Gn 4: 3-5 )</p>
<p></p>
<p>Something similar to this is told in Malachi 1: 8 in respect to the offerings the priests were sacrificing. They
    didn't look for the best for God, and because of that God did not accept the offerings they offered in the
    Temple.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"<i>And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? And if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? Offer
    it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, <strong>or accept thy person</strong>? saith the LORD of
    hosts</i>." ( Malachi 1: 8 )</p>
<p></p>
<p>What Cain and Abel did at that time was not a ceremony of sin repentance, or an offering for their sins. That is why
    <strong>they did not have to offer necessarily a blood sacrifice.</strong> What Cain and Abel did was an act of
    worshiping in which each one chose what he supposed God deserved. That is why Cain's offering was rejected.</p>
