<p><strong>How to better understand the prophetic sermon</strong></p>
<p> With some analysis of the 24th chapter of Matthew we will notice that it consists of six sections<strong>:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>First section,</strong> verses 1-2<strong>,</strong> in which the destruction of the Temple is specifically
    and exclusively treated<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Second section,</strong> verse 3<strong>,</strong> in which the disciples ask Jesus three questions which he
    goes on to answer in the same order<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Third section,</strong> verses 4-6 in which Jesus answers the first question<strong>,</strong> the one
    referring to the destruction of the Temple<strong>.</strong> In addition he gives a brief prediction of what would
    occur in the era of the apostles<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fourth section,</strong> verses 7-14<strong>,</strong> in which he responds to the second and third questions<strong>,</strong>
    making a brief and concise outline of the events that will occur in the period near the end of the
    World<strong>,</strong> from the World wars until the Second Coming<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fifth section,</strong> verses 15-34<strong>,</strong> in which he details the period between the emergence
    of the Abomination of Desolation and the Second Coming<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sixth section,</strong> verses 35-51<strong>,</strong> in which he describes how certain events would
    transpire during the Second Coming<strong>,</strong> and gives similes and admonitions about how to carry oneself at
    that time<strong>,</strong> and how it would be like<strong>.</strong> Let's analyze the different
    sections<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The first section</strong> (Mt 24<strong>:</strong>1-2) <strong>evidently refers to the past,</strong> since
    it speaks of the destruction of the Temple<strong>,</strong> which occurred on 70
    A<strong>.</strong>D<strong>.</strong> In other passages<strong>,</strong> as in Luke
    19<strong>:</strong>43-44<strong>,</strong> Jesus also mentions the destruction of the Temple<strong>,</strong> at
    that time it was still in the future<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> It should be noted<strong>,</strong> however<strong>,</strong> that in the episode narrated <strong>in the
    previously mentioned portion of Luke,</strong> Jesus is not speaking to the disciples in the Temple nor in the Mount
    of Olives<strong>,</strong> but rather it is a separate occasion from that of the Prophetic Sermon<strong>.</strong>
    It is during the entrance to Jerusalem during what is commonly called Palm Sunday<strong>.</strong> Regardless of
    this<strong>,</strong> the prophecy regarding the Temple is the same one<strong>,</strong> but in this
    one<strong>,</strong> in addition<strong>,</strong> he gives <strong>the reason that the destruction occurred, that
        is to say: that they did not know the time of their visitation.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong>43 <i>For the days shall come upon thee<strong>,</strong> that thine enemies shall cast a trench
    about thee<strong>,</strong> and compass thee round<strong>,</strong> and keep thee in on every
    side<strong>,</strong></i> 44 <i>And shall lay thee even with the ground<strong>,</strong> and thy children within
    thee<strong>;</strong> and <strong>they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the
        time of thy visitation</strong></i><strong>."</strong> (Lk 19<strong>:</strong>43-44)</p>
<p> As we see<strong>,</strong> Jesus links in this portion of Luke<strong>,</strong> the destruction of Jerusalem and
    the Temple with the perverse behavior of that generation<strong>.</strong> <strong>Hence, it is logical to think
        that the destruction announced at that moment would occur during that generation, in that apostolic
        era.</strong> In other words<strong>,</strong> it is an event of the past<strong>,</strong> not of the present
    or of the future<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> For a third person which was not privy to a conversation<strong>,</strong> to fully understand the answer given by
    someone to another person asking the question<strong>,</strong> it is necessary that they first listen to what the
    question was to begin with<strong>.</strong> And if it is in any way possible<strong>,</strong> to figure out the
    physical and psychological environment<strong>,</strong> without arriving at ridiculous exaggerations that always
    lead to error<strong>.</strong> Let us proceed this way with this 24th chapter and this
    conversation<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> After Jesus had finished rebuking the Scribes and Pharisees<strong>,</strong> to their own face<strong>,</strong>
    their hypocrisies<strong>,</strong> wickedness<strong>,</strong> etc<strong>.,</strong> (chapter
    23)<strong>,</strong> he was withdrawing from the Temple<strong>,</strong> at the same time that <strong>his
        disciples, apparently commenting about the majesty of its architecture, were pointing out the Temple buildings
        to him</strong> (Matthew 24<strong>:</strong>1)<strong>.</strong> I am saying that the disciples were speaking
    full of admiration for that architecture<strong>,</strong> because that is seen more clearly in Mark
    13<strong>:</strong>1 where one of his disciples mentions the same saying<strong>:</strong> <strong>"</strong><i>Teacher<strong>,</strong>
        see <strong>what stones, and what buildings</strong></i><strong>."</strong></p>
<p> Responding to these words from the disciples in Matthew<strong>,</strong> Jesus<strong>,</strong> <strong>referring
    obviously to the buildings that were being praised,</strong> said that a stone would not remain upon a stone<strong>,</strong>
    thus predicting in a general and brief way<strong>,</strong> the total destruction of that Temple (verse
    2)<strong>.</strong> It was this Temple which the Jews believed constituted an insurance policy against divine
    retribution<strong>,</strong> given that God would not permit (or so they believed) that His Temple would be
    destroyed<strong>,</strong> as we can see in Jeremiah 7<strong>:</strong>3-4<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong>1 <i>And Jesus went out<strong>,</strong> and departed from the Temple<strong>,</strong> and his
    disciples came to him for <strong>to shew him the buildings of the Temple.</strong></i> 2 <i>And Jesus said unto
    them<strong>:</strong> See ye not all these things<strong>?</strong> Verily I say unto you<strong>:</strong> There
    shall not be left here one stone upon another<strong>,</strong> that shall not be thrown down</i><strong>."</strong>
    (First Section<strong>,</strong> Mt 24<strong>:</strong>1-2)</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong>3 <i>Thus</i> <i>saith the LORD of hosts<strong>,</strong> the God of Israel<strong>:</strong>
    Amend your ways and your doings<strong>,</strong> and I will cause you to dwell in this place<strong>.</strong></i>
    4 <i>Trust ye not in lying words<strong>,</strong> saying<strong>:</strong> <strong>The Temple of the LORD, the
        Temple of the LORD, the Temple of the LORD, are these</strong></i><strong>."</strong> (Jer 7<strong>:</strong>3-4)
</p>
<p><strong>After letting them know of the future destruction of the Temple,</strong> Jesus continued to
    walk<strong>,</strong> and when he got to the Mount of Olives he sat down<strong>; then four of his disciples,
        taking him aside, asked him three questions:</strong> <strong>a)</strong> When would these things happen<strong>?</strong>
    By saying <strong>"</strong>these things<strong>"</strong> they were referring without a doubt to what Jesus had
    just spoken about<strong>,</strong> namely the destruction of the Temple<strong>.</strong> Afterwards they make two
    questions about events that Jesus had not mentioned<strong>,</strong> but which were of interest to
    them<strong>,</strong> and are the following<strong>:</strong> <strong>b)</strong> What sign will there be of your
    Second Coming<strong>?;</strong> and <strong>c)</strong> What sign would there be of the end of the
    World<strong>?</strong> The answers to these three questions<strong>,</strong> and in the same
    order<strong>,</strong> is what we would expect from Jesus<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> Now then<strong>,</strong> notice that the prophetic sermon was not given in public<strong>,</strong> but rather was
    told to Peter<strong>,</strong> James<strong>,</strong> John and Andrew as we see in Mark
    13<strong>:</strong>3<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong><i>And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the Temple<strong>,</strong> Peter and James
    and John and Andrew asked him <strong>privately</strong></i><strong>.".</strong> (Mark 13<strong>:</strong>3)</p>
<p><strong>In summary:</strong> the first section encompasses only what Jesus said about the destruction of the
    Temple<strong>,</strong> and what had triggered the three questions we spoke about<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The second section (</strong>Matthew 24<strong>:</strong>3) limits itself to mentioning the three questions
    that the disciples made to Jesus<strong>,</strong> it does not require any explanation<strong>,</strong> except to
    keep them in mind in order to understand the answers<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong><i>And as he sat upon the mount of Olives<strong>,</strong> <strong>the disciples</strong> came
    unto him <strong>privately</strong><strong>,</strong> saying<strong>:</strong> Tell us<strong>,</strong> <strong>when
        shall these things be? And what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the
        world.?</strong></i><strong>"</strong> (Second Section<strong>,</strong> Mt 24<strong>:</strong>3)</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> Let us analyze the third and fourth sections together in order to facilitate the study<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The third section (</strong>Matthew 24<strong>:</strong>4-6) <strong>and</strong></p>
<p><strong>The fourth section (</strong>Matthew 24<strong>:</strong>7-14) </p>
<p></p>
<p> The third section refers to the apostolic age<strong>;</strong> and the one following it<strong>,</strong> the
    fourth<strong>,</strong> refers to the current age and the future<strong>.</strong> We will now demonstrate that
    these two periods<strong>,</strong> those corresponding to the third and fourth sections<strong>,</strong> are
    different<strong>;</strong> and we will realize that <strong>there is a jump of several centuries between verse 6
        and 7.</strong> I base myself on five arguments<strong>,</strong> to conclude that it is referring to two
    separate periods<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>First argument about the 3rd and 4th sections</strong><strong>.</strong> Having spoken in verse six about
    wars<strong>,</strong> it is not logical that in verse seven he speaks again of the same wars he had already
    mentioned<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Second argument about the 3rd and 4th sections</strong><strong>.</strong> This third section that we are
    analyzing ends with verse six<strong>.</strong> In that verse Jesus speaks of wars and rumors of
    wars<strong>,</strong> telling the disciples not to be troubled by that<strong>,</strong> given that it would not
    yet be the end<strong>. If it still is not the end it is because this period of wars of which verse six speaks, will
        not last until the Second Coming.</strong> However<strong>,</strong> when we read the next one<strong>,</strong>
    verse seven<strong>,</strong> which is the beginning of the fourth section<strong>,</strong> we can see that the
    events narrated there follow each other continuously until the end<strong>. In other words, that the period that
        begins with the wars narrated in verse seven (fourth section) do reach the end;</strong> but the event begun in
    verse four and ending in verse six (third section) <strong>do not</strong> go on to the end<strong>.</strong> It is
    clear that the two periods are different<strong>.</strong> Let us see<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong>4 <i>And Jesus answered and said unto them<strong>:</strong> Take heed that no man deceive
    you<strong>.</strong></i> 5 <i>For many shall come in my name<strong>,</strong> saying<strong>:</strong> I am Christ<strong>;</strong>
    and shall deceive many<strong>.</strong></i> 6 <strong>And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of
    wars</strong><strong>;</strong> <i>see that ye be not troubled<strong>,</strong> for all these things must come to
    pass<strong>,</strong> <strong>but the end is not yet</strong></i><strong>.</strong><strong>"</strong> (<strong>Third
    Section, Mt</strong> 24<strong>:</strong>4-6)</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong>7 <i>For</i> <i>nation <strong>shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom,</strong> and
    there shall be famines<strong>,</strong> and pestilences<strong>,</strong> <strong>and earthquakes, in divers
        places</strong><strong>.</strong></i> 8 <i>All these are <strong>the beginning of
    sorrows</strong><strong>.</strong></i> 9 <i>Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted<strong>,</strong> and
    shall kill you<strong>;</strong> and ye shall be hated <strong>of all nations</strong> for my name's
    sake<strong>.</strong></i> 10 <i>And then shall many be offended<strong>,</strong> and shall betray one
    another<strong>,</strong> and shall hate one another<strong>.</strong></i> 11 <i>And many false prophets shall
    rise<strong>,</strong> and shall deceive many<strong>.</strong></i> 12 <i>And because iniquity shall
    abound<strong>,</strong> the love of many shall wax cold<strong>.</strong></i> 13 <strong>But he that shall endure
    unto the end,</strong> <i>the same shall be saved<strong>.</strong></i> 14 <i>And <strong>this gospel of the kingdom
    shall be preached in all the world</strong> for a witness unto all nations<strong>;</strong> and <strong>then shall
    the end come</strong></i><strong>."</strong> (<strong>Fourth Section, Mt</strong> 24<strong>:</strong>7-14)</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Third argument about the 3rd and 4th sections</strong><strong>.</strong> In verse 6 <strong>a type of local
    war is being narrated</strong><strong>, more like seditions and uprisings;</strong> but when we move to verse
    7<strong>,</strong> a different type of war is mentioned<strong>;</strong> one in which <strong>nation will rise
        against nation and kingdom against kingdom. This is registered in history only in modern times with the two
        World Wars</strong><strong>.</strong> Hence<strong>,</strong> it is obvious that verse 7 refers to the current
    time<strong>,</strong> whereas verse 6 refers to the apostolic age<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> At that time the Roman Empire dominated all the nations of the known world, and there couldn't be a war that would
    have nation rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, because there was only one kingdom, the Roman
    Empire.</p>
<p> Remember the phrase "Pax romana", which was famous in those days and even today. This famous phrase indicates to us
    the tranquility imposed by the empire on all the nations of those days. There could not be during the era of the
    "Pax romana" something similar to that described as "nation against nation and kingdom against kingdom".</p>
<p> Hence the wars described in verse 6 are different than those described in verse 7<strong>.</strong> Those of verse 6
    can be applied to the Roman era<strong>;</strong> those of verse 7 cannot<strong>.</strong>
    Besides<strong>,</strong> <strong>from history we know that at that time there were no wars of that type where
        nations would arise against nation and kingdom against kingdom</strong><strong>.</strong> It is logical then to
    think that what is described in verse 7 does not pertain to those times<strong>,</strong> but rather to the
    present<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> Everything said previously is also confirmed by the description given by Luke about the same period of the prophecy.
    We can see that in Luke 21:7-11 where the narration gives a better description of the events in Judea in the period
    immediately after the resurrection to the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple. There it speaks of seditions,
    which is what characterized the Jewish history of that period, according to Josephus's chronicle.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong>7 <i>And they asked him<strong>,</strong> saying<strong>:</strong> Master<strong>,</strong> but
    when shall these things be<strong>?</strong> And what sign will there be when these things shall come to
    pass<strong>?</strong> </i> 8 <i>And he said<strong>:</strong> Take heed that ye be not deceived<strong>,</strong>
    for many shall come in my name<strong>,</strong> saying<strong>:</strong> I am Christ<strong>;</strong> and the time
    draweth near<strong>;</strong> go ye not therefore after them<strong>.</strong></i> 9 <i>But when ye shall hear of
    wars and <strong>commotions</strong><strong>,</strong> be not terrified<strong>,</strong> for these things must
    first come to pass<strong>;</strong> <strong>but the end is not by and by</strong><strong>.</strong></i> 10 <i>Then
    said he unto them<strong>:</strong> Nation shall rise against nation<strong>,</strong> and kingdom against
    kingdom<strong>.</strong></i> 11 <i>And</i> <i>great earthquakes shall be in divers places<strong>,</strong> and
    famines<strong>,</strong> and pestilences<strong>;</strong> and <strong>fearful sights and great signs shall there
        be from heaven</strong></i><strong>."</strong> (Lk 21<strong>:</strong>7-11)</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Fourth argument about the 3rd and 4th sections</strong><strong>.</strong> To be more certain yet that verses
    6 and 7 of Matthew 24<strong>,</strong> deal with two different times and quite distant in time from each
    other<strong>,</strong> it would be enough to realize that the wars mentioned in verse 7 begin the period called
    <strong>"beginning of sorrows"</strong><strong>.</strong> Likewise notice that the phenomena that accompany the wars
    of Matthew 24<strong>:</strong>7<strong>,</strong> <strong>earthquakes in diverse places</strong><strong>,</strong>
    <strong>great fears and great signs of heaven</strong><strong>,</strong> have never happened in Roman era nor
    later<strong>.</strong> Hence<strong>,</strong> it is evident that what is said in verse 7 refers to a time after
    the ones we know from history<strong>.</strong> History allows us to assert that <strong>in that apostolic age none
        of the great fearsome events and signs of heaven occurred</strong><strong>; they are still in the
        future.</strong></p>
<p> If we read Mark 13<strong>:</strong>8 and Luke 21<strong>:</strong>10-11 & 24-26<strong>,</strong> we would see that
    they also announce for the period immediately following the period characterized by nation against nation and
    kingdom against kingdom<strong>,</strong> the seismic activity and cosmic phenomena <strong>which did not occur
        during that apostolic age.</strong> That is to say<strong>,</strong> <strong>great signs in
        heaven</strong><strong>,</strong> fearful sights<strong>, earthquakes and in many places,</strong> <strong>anguish
        from fear of something that will occur in the sea, and men's hearts failing because of
        fear</strong><strong>.</strong> Hence<strong>,</strong> if these things did not occur then<strong>,</strong>
    <strong>it is without doubt</strong> that those things will happen at a future occasion<strong>.</strong>
    Therefore<strong>,</strong> verses 6 and 7 speak about different times<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong><i>For nation shall rise against nation<strong>,</strong> and kingdom against
    kingdom<strong>;</strong> and <strong>there shall be earthquakes in divers places</strong><strong>,</strong> and
    there shall be famines and troubles<strong>; these are the beginnings of sorrows</strong></i><strong>."</strong> (Mk
    13<strong>:</strong>8)</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong>10 <i>Then said he unto them<strong>:</strong> <strong>Nation shall rise against nation, and
    kingdom against kingdom</strong><strong>;</strong></i> 11 <i>and <strong>great earthquakes</strong> shall be in
    divers places<strong>,</strong> and famines<strong>,</strong> and pestilences<strong>;</strong> and <strong>fearful
        sights and great signs shall there be from heaven</strong></i><strong>." </strong> (Lk 21<strong>:</strong>10-11)
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong>24 <i>And they shall fall by the edge of the sword<strong>,</strong> and shall be led away captive
    into all nations<strong>.</strong> <strong>And Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of
        the Gentiles be fulfilled.</strong></i> 25 <strong> </strong><strong>And</strong> <strong>there shall be signs
    in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the Earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and
    the waves roaring;</strong> 26 <strong>men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which
    are coming on the earth,</strong> <i>for the powers of heaven shall be shaken</i><strong>."</strong> (Lk
    21<strong>:</strong>24-26)</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Fifth argument about the 3rd and 4th sections</strong><strong>.</strong> If we read Matthew
    24<strong>:</strong>13<strong>,</strong> which is the next to the last verse of the fourth section<strong>,</strong>
    we will see that it says that those which remain alive at that moment should endure unto the end<strong>.</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong><i>But he that shall <strong>endure unto the end, the same shall be
    saved</strong></i><strong>."</strong> (Mt 24<strong>:</strong>13)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>It does not make sense that a Christian of the apostolic era would be admonished to endure until the end of
    the world</strong><strong>;</strong> the reasonable thing would be that it is speaking to the Christians of the
    times close to the end<strong>.</strong> Neither would a Christian close to the time of the Second Coming be
    admonished<strong>,</strong> to endure until the end<strong>,</strong> if there remained say<strong>,</strong> fifty
    years<strong>,</strong> still<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> For greater comprehension of what I am saying with respect to the transition from verse six to seven, we could
    paraphrase this portion the following way:</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong>6 and you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars<strong>,</strong> see that you do not become
    unsettled over this<strong>,</strong> because it is necessary that all this should happen<strong>,</strong> but it
    is not yet the end of the world<strong>.</strong> 7 Because the end of the world shall be near when nation rises
    against nation and kingdom against kingdom<strong>,</strong> and there shall be plagues<strong>,</strong> famines
    and earthquakes in many places<strong>,</strong> but these things are not the exact end either<strong>,</strong> 8
    but rather the signs that announce the beginning of the period called <strong>"</strong>beginning of birth
    pains<strong>"</strong><strong>.</strong> 9 It shall be then that you shall be delivered to be afflicted and you
    shall be killed<strong>..."</strong> (Paraphrase of Mt 24<strong>:</strong>6-9)</p>
<p></p>
<p> Once we get to this point in time, the only thing that separates us from the end is to wait for the Gospel to be
    preached in the whole world, according to verse 14 of Matthew 24; which seems to happen in the miraculous way
    referred to in Revelation 14:6.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"<i>And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven</i><i>,</i> <i>having the everlasting gospel to preach unto
    them that dwell on the Earth</i><i>,</i> <i>and to every nation</i><i>,</i> <i>and kindred</i><i>,</i> <i>and
    tongue</i><i>,</i> <i>and people</i>." (Rev 14:6)</p>
<p></p>
<p> Having demonstrated that verses 4 to 6 (third section) and the other one that goes from 7 to 14 (fourth section)
    deal with different periods of time<strong>,</strong> we will continue to analyze the chapter<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong> In summary:</strong> Matthew 24<strong>:</strong>4-6 and Matthew 24<strong>:</strong>7-14<strong>,</strong>
    narrate two periods with some similarities<strong>,</strong> but completely different in time<strong>.</strong> The
    first pertains to the apostolic era and the second one to the current time and its future<strong>.</strong> In one
    it says that it is not the end<strong>,</strong> in the other the narration reaches to the end<strong>.</strong> In
    the first there could be no world wars<strong>,</strong> but only seditions<strong>,</strong> in the second there
    are world wars<strong>.</strong> In the first one there were no signs in heaven as he says that there will be during
    the second<strong>.</strong> In the second section he admonishes to hold on until the end<strong>,</strong> but not
    in the first portion<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> Fifth section</strong><strong>,</strong> (Matthew 24<strong>:</strong>15-34) This section is as if we would
    examine a small section of a map with a magnifying glass<strong>,</strong> in order to see more
    details<strong>;</strong> or as if a section of a map had been enlarged onto a separate inset<strong>,</strong> to
    see the details better<strong>.</strong> What is being detailed in this section<strong>,</strong> or what is being
    examined with the magnifying glass<strong>,</strong> is <strong>the span of time between the rise of the Abomination
        of Desolation, and the Second Coming, which was treated already in the fourth section (verses 7-14), but not in
        detail</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong>15 <strong>When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation,</strong> <i>spoken of by
    Daniel the prophet<strong>,</strong> <strong>stand in the holy place</strong><strong>,</strong> (whoso
    readeth<strong>,</strong> let him understand)<strong>,</strong></i> 16 <i>then let them which be in Judaea flee into
    the mountains<strong>;</strong></i> 17 <i>let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of
    his house<strong>;</strong></i> 18 <i>neither let him which is in the field<strong>,</strong> return back to take
    his clothes<strong>.</strong></i> 19 <i>And woe unto them that are with child<strong>,</strong> and to them that
    give suck in those days<strong>!</strong></i> 20 <i>But pray ye that your flight be not in the
    winter<strong>,</strong> neither on the Sabbath day<strong>.</strong></i> 21 <strong>For then shall be great
    tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.</strong> 22 <i>And
    except those days should be shortened<strong>,</strong> there should no flesh be saved<strong>;</strong> but for the
    elect's sake those days shall be shortened<strong>.</strong></i> 23 <i>Then if any man shall say unto
    you<strong>,</strong> Lo<strong>,</strong> here is Christ<strong>,</strong> or there<strong>;</strong> believe it
    not<strong>.</strong></i> 24 <strong>For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great
    signs and wonders</strong><strong>;</strong> <i>insomuch that<strong>,</strong> if it were
    possible<strong>,</strong> they shall deceive the very elect<strong>.</strong></i> 25 <i>Behold<strong>,</strong> I
    have told you before<strong>.</strong></i> 26 <i>Wherefore if they shall say unto you<strong>:</strong>
    Behold<strong>,</strong> he is in the desert<strong>;</strong> go not forth<strong>;</strong>
    behold<strong>,</strong> he is in the secret chambers<strong>;</strong> believe it not<strong>.</strong></i> 27 <i>For
    as the lightning cometh out of the east<strong>,</strong> and shineth even unto the west<strong>;</strong> so shall
    also the coming of the Son of man be<strong>.</strong></i> 28 <i>For wheresoever the carcase is<strong>,</strong>
    there will the eagles be gathered together<strong>.</strong></i> 29 <strong>Immediately after the tribulation of
    those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven,
    and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.</strong> 30 <i>And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in
    heaven<strong>;</strong> and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn<strong>,</strong> and they shall see the
    Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory<strong>.</strong></i> 31 <i>And he shall send
    his angels with a great sound of a trumpet<strong>,</strong> <strong>and they shall gather together his elect from
        the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other</strong><strong>.</strong></i> 32 <i>Now learn a parable of
    the fig tree<strong>:</strong> when his branch is yet tender<strong>,</strong> and putteth forth
    leaves<strong>,</strong> ye know that summer is nigh<strong>.</strong></i> 33 <i>So likewise ye<strong>,</strong>
    when ye shall see all these things<strong>,</strong> know that it is near<strong>,</strong> even at the doors</i> 34
    <i>Verily I say unto you<strong>: This generation shall not pass, till all these things be
        fulfilled</strong></i><strong>."</strong> (Mt 24<strong>:</strong>15-34)</p>
<p></p>
<p> As we saw in the beginning of the study of the Prophetic Sermon<strong>,</strong> its fourth
    section<strong>,</strong> which encompasses verses 7-14<strong>,</strong> was a concise outline of the events that
    will occur in the time near the end<strong>.</strong> At that moment that Jesus spoke<strong>,</strong> those things
    were all in the future<strong>.</strong> Nevertheless<strong>,</strong> for us today<strong>,</strong> some of
    them<strong>,</strong> like the World Wars<strong>,</strong> are already in the past<strong>,</strong> but
    others<strong>,</strong> like the Abomination<strong>,</strong> are still in the future<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> The Fifth Section of the Prophetic Sermon<strong>,</strong> (verses 15-34)<strong>,</strong> details for us what
    will happen from the appearance of the Abomination<strong>,</strong> until the Second Coming<strong>.</strong> We
    shall analyze this section<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>I am going to make now five comments</strong> about this portion<strong>,</strong> and later on I will
    provide <strong>seven arguments</strong> to demonstrate that <strong>this passage must be referring to the
        end</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p> a) This "Abomination of Desolation", mentioned in verse 15 is still in the future, and hence so is everything
    narrated in verses 15 to 34. Let's see.</p>
<p> b) Verse 15 says that the abomination would be in the holy place; it does not say that it would destroy the holy
    place, which is what the Romans did. Hence it is logical to think that it is referring to the current time not the
    apostolic age. Not only does it refer to the current future, but also by logic, we see that the warning is being
    made to Christian Jews of that current future, since the non-believing Jews would not read the New Testament, and
    the Christian Gentiles do not need to leave Judea, unless they are tourists or missionaries there. It refers to the
    future illegitimate temple that will be constructed in Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>c) </strong> By the emphasis that Jesus places on the urgency with which the Christians that find themselves
    in Judea must be careful and flee (verses 17 and 18)<strong>,</strong> we can deduce that <strong>the events will be
        triggered suddenly, without announcements or previous signs that foretell their imminent
        occurrence</strong><strong>.</strong> It gives the sense that <strong>the escape of the brethren will have to
        happen within minutes</strong><strong>,</strong> because he emphasizes not to lose even the few minutes that it
    would take for them to retrieve a garment<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> The assumption that the Christians in Judea will have to react fast before the unfolding events<strong>,</strong>
    agrees with the lament regarding the pregnant women and those with small children<strong>,</strong> who will be
    impeded by their physical and physiological conditions<strong>,</strong> in acting with the required urgency and in
    suffering the scarcities of the situation<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> What is mentioned about not seeking the overcoat<strong>,</strong> and the fact that in verse 20 he admonishes to
    pray that it would not happen in either the winter or Saturday<strong>,</strong> <strong>makes me think that it is
        in a Saturday of the winter season, when the rebellious spiritual powers will attempt to bring about their
        plan</strong><strong>.</strong> It would not be foolish then<strong>,</strong> on the part of the Christians of
    that future time which find themselves in Judea<strong>,</strong> that they should leave from the beginning of any
    strange event that they observe<strong>,</strong> and to maintain themselves alert to any news or rumors during
    those days<strong>,</strong> especially all the winter Saturdays or close to the winter<strong>.</strong> Better yet<strong>,</strong>
    move from there as soon as it is possible<strong>,</strong> specially before the winter begins<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> Also the admonishment to not look for an overcoat may have another motive<strong>,</strong> like <strong>not raising
    suspicion that one is leaving for good</strong><strong>,</strong> but rather to look as if one is leaving the city
    to return later<strong>.</strong> Whoever leaves without bags<strong>,</strong> with their usual
    clothing<strong>,</strong> will not awake suspicion that they are leaving for good<strong>,</strong> which would
    alert authorities<strong>,</strong> or the mob which supports tyrannies<strong>,</strong> in the sense that those
    that leave are dissidents of the regime of the antiChrist<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> Perhaps<strong>,</strong> thanks to the prayers of Christians<strong>,</strong> the plans designed by the wicked to
    be carried out on a winter Saturday<strong>,</strong> would have to be postponed or precipitated due to the presence
    of unpredictable circumstances for them<strong>,</strong> with which perhaps the events may not occur in
    winter<strong>,</strong> but on Saturday<strong>,</strong> or perhaps not on a Saturday<strong>,</strong> but in
    winter<strong>;</strong> or perhaps in neither Saturday nor winter<strong>,</strong> though not very far from
    them<strong>. We must then pray for this important issue, that God may upset the plans of the wicked that day, and
        the brethren may be spared.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This warning cannot be referring to Christians throughout the world</strong><strong>,</strong> because the
    winter Saturdays in Judea<strong>,</strong> are summer Saturdays in Brazil<strong>,</strong>
    Argentina<strong>,</strong> Africa<strong>,</strong> Australia and the whole southern hemisphere<strong>.</strong>
    Besides<strong>,</strong> evidently<strong>,</strong> verse 16 refers to those in Judea<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>d) </strong> After this flight of the Christians that find themselves in Jerusalem and all Judea the greatest
    tribulation to ever exist will begin<strong>.</strong> That is<strong>,</strong> the Great
    Tribulation<strong>,</strong> according to verses 21-22<strong>,</strong> and it will give rise to the period of
    false Christ and false prophets which will give great signs and wonders capable of deceiving even certain Christians<strong>,</strong>
    as verses 23-28 warn<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>e) When the Great Tribulation is nearing its end or has already ended</strong><strong>, that is, "After the
    affliction of those days",</strong> as it says in verse 29<strong>,</strong> the sun and the moon shall
    darken<strong>,</strong> and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of heaven shall be
    shaken<strong>.</strong> It will be then that according to verse 30<strong>,</strong> the sign of Christ shall
    appear in the heavens (perhaps the cross) and Jesus will be seen in his Second Coming<strong>,</strong> this time on
    the clouds<strong>,</strong> from where he will order the gathering of his chosen (31) from throughout the
    world<strong>.</strong> That is how this passage of the fifth section ends<strong>,</strong> and which lets us see
    in more detail<strong>,</strong> the sequence of events from the time of the abomination to the gathering of the
    Christians<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Having wrapped up the five comments, we will speak of the seven arguments.</strong> I shall analyze some
    details of this portion (15-34) in order to <strong>reaffirm the idea that this fifth section refers to the
        end.</strong> For that I base myself on seven arguments<strong>:</strong> <strong>First:</strong> The Great
    Tribulation spoken of in this portion has not happened yet<strong>.</strong> <strong>Second:</strong> The antiChrist
    has not appeared yet<strong>.</strong> <strong>Third:</strong> No flesh would be saved if the tribulation should
    last longer<strong>.</strong> <strong>Fourth:</strong> The miracles of the false Christs and prophets have not
    happened yet<strong>.</strong> <strong>Fifth:</strong> Neither the sun or moon darkened nor the stars fell during
    the apostolic era<strong>.</strong> <strong>Sixth:</strong> This was not <strong>"</strong>at the
    door<strong>"</strong> during the apostolic era<strong>,</strong> since twenty centuries have
    passed<strong>.</strong> <strong>Seventh:</strong> That generation of the apostolic era passed and all these things
    did not happen<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong> First argument of the 5th section</strong><strong>: The Great Tribulation has not come yet.</strong> Verse
    21 says that during these events described in verses from 15 to 20<strong>,</strong> there would be an affliction so
    great like there has not been since the beginning of the world nor would happen again<strong>;</strong> and the one
    that says this is the one with the most authority to know this<strong>:</strong> Jesus<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong><i>For then shall be great tribulation<strong>, such as was not since the beginning of the world to
    this time, no, nor ever shall be</strong></i><strong>." </strong> (Mt 24<strong>:</strong>21)</p>
<p></p>
<p> If anyone should think that the events and tribulation mentioned by Jesus, belong to those that already happened
    during the apostolic period, during the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple, we would have to suppose that the
    future affliction to come upon the world, the one called Great Tribulation, is going to be less than the one during
    Roman times. To hold this second hypothesis would be equivalent to supposing that the affliction caused by the
    antiChrist, the most perverse and cruel of the persecutors of Christianity, would be lighter and less cruel than
    those caused by the Roman Empire, which seems absurd to me. Hence, seeing that the prophecy of the Great Tribulation
    remains to be fulfilled, we have to come to the conclusion that the passage under study refers to the end of the
    world.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong> Second argument of the 5th section</strong><strong>: The antiChrist has not come yet. </strong> Neither can
    it be asserted that the Roman Empire<strong>,</strong> or one of the emperors<strong>,</strong> had been the
    antiChrist<strong>, because none of them sat in the Temple of God,</strong> like God<strong>,</strong> making
    himself to look like God<strong>,</strong> which is what Saint Paul predicted in Second Thessalonians that the
    antiChrist would do<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong><i>Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God<strong>,</strong> or that is
    worshipped<strong>;</strong> so that he as God <strong>sitteth</strong> <strong>in the temple of God, shewing
        himself that he is God</strong></i><strong>."</strong> (II Tes 2<strong>:</strong>4)</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Third argument of the 5th section</strong><strong>: Afflictions of the apostolic era were sporadic and
    regional,</strong> Verse 22 says that if this affliction should continue any longer<strong>,</strong> no flesh would
    be saved<strong>;</strong> perhaps because they would desert the faith because they could not withstand the
    pressures<strong>,</strong> sufferings and cruelties<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong><i>And <strong>except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be
    saved</strong><strong>;</strong> but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened</i><strong>."</strong> (Mt
    24<strong>:</strong>22)</p>
<p></p>
<p> It seems to me that these words cannot refer to the afflictions of the apostolic age. I do not believe that this
    could apply to those times, because in spite of the fact that their afflictions were great and cruel, reaching
    martyrdom, they were not continuous, speaking chronologically, nor total speaking geographically. Those afflictions
    were sporadic in the first case, and regional in the second, as is shown in Acts 9:31. There were regions, as much
    Barbarian as Roman, which did not suffer the anti-Christian persecution and, hence, the Christians of those places,
    or that sought refuge there, would not have deserted from the faith.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"<i>Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria,</i></strong> <i>and were
    edified<strong>;</strong> and walking in the fear of the Lord<strong>,</strong> and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost<strong>,</strong>
    were multiplied</i><strong>."</strong> (Hch 9<strong>:</strong>31)</p>
<p></p>
<p> It is more logical to conclude that these predictions refer to modern times which are yet in the
    future<strong>,</strong> in which an inflexible worldwide and totalitarian organization<strong>,</strong> with
    adequate scientific and technical resources to do it<strong>,</strong> extends its merciless persecution to the most
    remote corners of its empire<strong>,</strong> causing with it such an affliction to every Christian which exists
    within those regions dominated by the antiChrist<strong>,</strong> which if they were to be
    prolonged<strong>,</strong> the brethren living there would desert from the faith because they were not able to
    either bear it or escape<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fourth argument of the 5th section</strong><strong>: The false "Christs" of the apostolic era never did signs
    and wonders.</strong> If we analyze verse 24 we would see that <strong>after the period of tribulation</strong>
    described in this passage<strong>,</strong> the <strong> false</strong> <strong>Christs and false prophets would
        arise</strong><strong>, who would do great signs and wonders.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong><i>For there shall arise <strong>false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and
    wonders</strong><strong>;</strong> insomuch that<strong>,</strong> if it were possible<strong>,</strong> they shall
    deceive the very elect</i><strong>."</strong> (Mt 24<strong>:</strong>24)</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>In the apostolic era even though there were false prophets and false "Christs", there were none that could do
    signs and wonders, neither great nor small</strong><strong>;</strong> and much less signs of such a level that they
    could deceive even the chosen<strong>.</strong> Hence<strong>,</strong> if the <strong>false "Christs" and false
        prophets of such great power did not arise during the apostolic age</strong><strong>,</strong> it is logical to
    think that Christ is referring in this verse<strong>,</strong> and in the whole passage<strong>,</strong> to the end
    of the world<strong>,</strong> and not to the apostolic age<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Fifth argument of the 5th section</strong><strong>: After the tribulation of the apostolic era the sun didn't
    darken, nor the moon, nor the stars fell.</strong> The same can be said of Matthew
    24<strong>:</strong>29<strong>,</strong> where it says that after the affliction described as
    unique<strong>,</strong> without parallel or repetition<strong>,</strong> that is<strong>,</strong> <strong>after
        the Great Tribulation</strong><strong>, the sun would darken as well as the moon, and the stars would
        fall.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong><i>Immediately <strong>after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon
    shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven,</strong> and the powers of the heavens shall be
    shaken</i><strong>."</strong> (Mt 24<strong>:</strong>29)</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>It is more than evident that after the afflictions of the apostolic age, the sun did not darken, neither did
    the moon, and much less did the stars fall</strong><strong>.</strong> Hence<strong>,</strong> I say
    again<strong>,</strong> Jesus was not referring here to the apostolic age<strong>,</strong> but rather to the future
    immediately before the Second Coming<strong>,</strong> that is the current future<strong>.</strong> That is to
    say<strong>,</strong> this whole passage is speaking of a period still in the future<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Sixth argument of the 5th section</strong><strong>: In the apostolic era the Second Coming was not at the
    doors.</strong> In verse 33 he says that when <strong>"</strong>these things<strong>"</strong> begin to
    happen<strong>,</strong> everything is at the doors<strong>.</strong> So neither can Jesus be referring here to the
    period of the apostles or to the immediately subsequent periods either<strong>.</strong> This is because here it
    says that <strong>at the very moment of which he was relating occurs</strong><strong>, everything else, including
        his Second Coming was at the door.</strong> Almost twenty centuries have passed and a ton of generations and the
    end has not come<strong>;</strong> which indicates to us that the events of the first and following
    centuries<strong>,</strong> were not the ones that Jesus was announcing as being at the door<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>"</strong><i>So likewise ye<strong>,</strong> when ye shall see all these things<strong>,</strong> <strong>know
    that it is near, even at the doors</strong></i><strong>.</strong> (Mt 24<strong>:</strong>33)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong> <strong>Seventh argument of the 5th section</strong><strong>.</strong> <strong>The apostolic
    generation passed and the rest of the signs never manifested.</strong> Also verse 34 indicates that nothing in this
    section refers to the apostolic period<strong>,</strong> because it says here that <strong>when one of those signs
        should occur, the living generation would see the rest of the signs,</strong> and that did not happen in the
    apostolic age<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>"</strong><i>Verily I say unto you<strong>:</strong> <strong>This generation shall not pass, till all these
    things be fulfilled</strong></i><strong>."</strong> (Mt 24<strong>:</strong>34)</p>
<p></p>
<p> From reading the whole passage under study (verses 15-34) it is easy to understand that <strong>the generation that
    will see the abomination, will also see the fall of the stars, the darkening of the sun and moon and the Second
    Coming of the Lord</strong><strong>.</strong> Hence<strong>,</strong> no one can claim that part of the events
    happened back then and part will happen in the future<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In summary:</strong> the fifth section<strong>,</strong> which encompasses Matthew
    24<strong>:</strong>15-34<strong>,</strong> is a detailed magnification<strong>,</strong> of the span encompassed
    between the emergence of the Abomination of Desolation<strong>,</strong> and the Second Coming<strong>.</strong>
    That is why the events narrated in it have not happened yet<strong>,</strong> like the Great
    Tribulation<strong>,</strong> the antiChrist<strong>,</strong> the wonders of the false Christs and prophets<strong>,</strong>
    the darkening of the sun and moon<strong>,</strong> nor have the stars fallen during the apostolic
    age<strong>.</strong> This proves to us that this section is in the future<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong> The sixth section</strong> (Matthew 24<strong>:</strong>35-51) I do not believe it is necessary to analyze
    this section<strong>,</strong> they are sufficiently clear admonitions that do not need
    explanation<strong>.</strong> This section only speaks of the certain fulfillment of this prophecy and of the secret
    which surrounds the day and hour of its occurrence<strong>.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Summarizing: chapter 24 of Matthew begins prophesying</strong> the destruction of the Temple in
    A<strong>.</strong>D<strong>.</strong> 70 (1 and 2)<strong>;</strong> later he gives a brief outline of what is
    going to happen during the apostolic age (verses 4-6)<strong>;</strong> later he makes another brief outline of what
    would happen from the World Wars until the Second Coming (verses 7-14)<strong>;</strong> then he expands a part of
    the previous passage<strong>,</strong> detailing the period that spans from the
    <strong>"</strong>Abomination<strong>"</strong> until <strong>"</strong>the Second Coming<strong>"</strong> (verses
    15-34)<strong>;</strong> and in the rest of the chapter he exhorts Christians about this important issue (verses
    35-51)<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> Let us now comment about some passages that can create confusion</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong> Matthew speaks of two times in which false Christs arise</strong><strong>.</strong> In Matthew
    24<strong>:</strong>5 Christians are warned about false Christs that would come during that apostolic
    age<strong>.</strong> This prophecy of the false Christs is repeated in Matthew
    24<strong>:</strong>24<strong>,</strong> but this time it refers to the times close to the Second
    Coming<strong>.</strong> This would be understood more clearly if we realize that verse 5 belongs to the third
    section which deals with the apostolic age<strong>,</strong> whereas verse 24 belongs to the fifth
    section<strong>,</strong> which deals with the end time<strong>.</strong> Both of these claims were previously
    demonstrated<strong>,</strong> it should be enough to read again both sections<strong>.</strong></p>
<p> We also see in Luke 21:8, where it discusses the apostolic age, the false Christs are mentioned as coming also in
    that age. And it is known that it is speaking of the apostolic age not only because it is in the passage which
    speaks of that era, but also because when Jesus speaks of the false Christs there, he adds "...and the time is
    near". If he told the apostles that the time was near, it is because those false Christs and false prophets were
    going to arise during that era also.</p>
<p> It does not escape my notice the fact that in Luke 21:8 the sentence "the time is near", begins with capital letters
    by the modern Bibles, like indicating that it deals with one of the two phrases spoken by the false Christs.
    According to this way of presenting these issues by those that edit these modern Bibles, the false Christs would say
    two phrases: 1) "I Am" and, 2) "The time is near". But this is a doctrinally prejudiced interpretation on the part
    of the one that edits this Bible.</p>
<p> In order to realize that it is incorrect to begin that sentence with a capital letter, it would be enough to read
    Luke 21:8 in the King James edition. In that edition, the sentence "the time is near" is found with lower case,
    because they did not consider it a new phrase, but rather a comment by Jesus with respect to the closeness of such
    false Christs.</p>
<p> But in addition, it is logical to think that the false Christs would not be saying that the time of Jesus' return
    was near, because they wanted to make others think that they were "Jesus" who had already returned. If they would
    say that the time is near, then they could not say that they were Christ, because they would be admitting that his
    Second Coming had not arrived with them. Hence we see that the same period of the prophecy, mentioned in Luke,
    agrees with the fact that Matthew 24:5 refers to false Christs of the apostolic age, whereas Matthew 24:24 refers to
    the false Christs which will come in the period close to the end.</p>
