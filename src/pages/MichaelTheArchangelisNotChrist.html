<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>There are those
who <u>try to de-christianize Christianity</u> without being noticed by
Christians.&nbsp; </b>They use several crooked methods, depending on the
denomination they are working in.&nbsp; One of the methods is to join a
denomination and then destroy or at least maim its Christian doctrines
from the inside out.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Russellites
spread the heretic idea that Jesus and Michael the Archangel are the same
person.</b>&nbsp; If they directly rejected Christ then Christians would
notice it.&nbsp; So, instead, without directly rejecting Christ, they subtly
deny his divinity by transforming him into just an archangel.&nbsp; They
are very shrewd in doing evil and in a very clever way.&nbsp; <b>The sad
part is that there are many good Christians</b> that recognize Christ's
divinity, and still believe that he and Michael, the Archangel, are the
same person.&nbsp; Let us see what the Scriptures say about it.</font>

of</u> the chief</b></font></i>
<br><b><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
prince<u>s</u></font></i></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>, came
to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia</i>."</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Dan 10: 5-13 abbreviated )</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this passage
the angel who speaks to Daniel says several things that <b>demonstrate
that Michael cannot be Christ.</b>&nbsp; Let us scrutinize this passage.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>First.</b>
The angel who speaks to Daniel <b>refers to Michael as a peer</b>, not
as someone superior.&nbsp; The angel speaks of Michael as one who is just
helping him .&nbsp; <b>Jesus is this angel's Lord, not his peer.</b>&nbsp;
Therefore, if he refers to Michael as his peer and not as his Lord, it
is because Michael is not Jesus.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Second.</b>&nbsp;
Let us focus our attention to the fact that according to the angel who
speaks to Daniel, <b>Michael is <u>one of several,</u> he is not unique.</b>&nbsp;
We know that the angel thinks this because of his phrase "<u>one of</u>
the chief princes".&nbsp; <b>If the angel used the word "princes" in
<u>plural</u></b>,
it is because he knows that there are several others like Michael.&nbsp;
This means that Michael is not the only one of his kind, but just <b><u>one
of them</u>, <u>one of several</u></b>.&nbsp; If there are several like
Michael, then that means that <b>there are several archangels.</b>&nbsp;
If Michael is "one of the chief prince<u>s</u>" is because he is not the
chief of them all.&nbsp; It is true that Michael is the only archangel
mentioned by name, but evidently he is not the only archangel.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>On the other
hand, Jesus is the only begotten son;</b> the only one of his kind.&nbsp;
If Michael is not the only one of his kind, he cannot be Jesus.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Third.</b>&nbsp;
As we read verse 21 of this same chapter 10 we learn that the angel who
spoke to Daniel said that Michael is the prince of the Hebrew people. He
limited him to just a race, just a nation; and Jesus is Lord and King of
all nations. Thus, Michael cannot be Jesus.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"<i>But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth;
and there</i></font>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
is none that holdeth with me in these things, but <b>Michael <u>your</u>
prince</b></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">."</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Dan 10: 21 )</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Fourth.</b>&nbsp;
If we read Jude 1:9 we learn of a fight, a dispute between Michael the
Archangel and the Devil, about something that had to do with Moses' body.&nbsp;
<b>Jesus does not have to fight or dispute with the Devil. Jesus only has
to give him orders, period.</b>&nbsp; Satan is in no way a match for Jesus!&nbsp;
Jesus is divine!&nbsp; Satan is just a creature.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This power of
Christ was evident even when Jesus was on the earth, clothed with flesh,
made a little lower than angels.&nbsp; During the temptation Jesus ordered
Satan to leave, <b>and he <u>had</u> to leave.</b>&nbsp; He could not argue
with Christ, or resist him, or merely dispute with him.&nbsp;<b> Satan
just <u>had to obey</u> Jesus at once.</b></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore if
Michael had to <b>dispute</b> with Satan, it is because Michael is not
Christ, but a being of much lower category than Jesus.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"<i>Yet Michael the archangel, when <b><u>contending</u> with the Devil
he
<u>disputed</u></b></i></font>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
about the body of Moses, <b>durst not</b> bring against him a railing accusation,</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
but said, <b><u>The Lord rebuke thee</u></b></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b><u>.</u></b>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Jude 1: 9 )</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a legion
of demons were possessing a man in the region of the Gergesenes, Jesus
did not have to dispute with them; he just ordered them to leave the possessed
man and
<b>they <u>had</u> to do so.</b>&nbsp; All through the gospels
we see that demons feared Jesus and begged him not to cast them into the
abyss.&nbsp; This shows us what an authority and potency Jesus had even
being in flesh. Jesus did not have to dispute, contend or struggle with
demons, he just had to speak, and that was it.&nbsp; How then can Russellites
convince anyone that Jesus is Michael the Archangel?</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Fifth.</b>&nbsp;
We also can see in Jude 1: 9 that Michael <b>did not <u>dare</u></b> to
bring a railing accusation against Satan.&nbsp; Are Russellites saying
that Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God cannot <b><u>dare</u></b>
to rebuke Satan? He is the Lord! He can do whatever he wants to do! He
is, and always has been, the Lord of all the angels, including Satan and
demons. The one that cannot dare to do anything against Jesus is Satan,
and not vice versa.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Sixth.</b>&nbsp;
In this same verse of Jude, Michael said: "The Lord rebuke thee".&nbsp;
If Michael asked the Lord to rebuke Satan it is because <b>Michael did
not consider that <u>he</u> was the Lord</b>, therefore Michael is not
the Lord Jesus Christ.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clear that
<b>the job Satan has given the Russellites is <u>to creep into Christianity</u>
and destroy or harm it from the inside out.</b>&nbsp; They are trying to
identify Jesus with Michael the Archangel in order to degrade Jesus. 
<b>This
is a Russellite heresy that many Christians have just gulped down,</b>
without realizing neither its theological consequences nor how heretical
the concept really is.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"<font size=-2>28 </font><i>And when he was come to the other side into
the country of the Gergesenes,</i></font>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs,
<b><u>exceeding</u></b></font></i>
<br><b><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<u>fierce</u>, so that no man might pass by that way.</font></i></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>
</i><font size=-2>29 </font><i>And, behold, they cried out,</i></font>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
saying, <b>What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou
come hither</b></font></i>
<br><b><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to <u>torment</u> us <u>before the time</u>?</font></i></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>
</i><font size=-2>30 </font><i>And there was a good way off from them an
herd</i></font>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of many swine feeding.&nbsp; </font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=-2>31
</font><i>So the <b>devils
<u>besought</u> him</b>, saying, If thou cast
us out,</i></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.&nbsp; </i><font size=-2>32
</font><i>And
he said unto them, Go. And when</i></font>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the
whole herd</font></i>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in
the waters</i>."</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Matt 8: 28-32 )</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we can see,
these demons were exceedingly fierce, but before the divine presence of
Jesus Christ they humiliated themselves, they besought and begged.&nbsp;
Jesus did not have to struggle, or dispute with them, so that they would
leave the possessed man.&nbsp; Jesus' presence terrified them, because
they were not sure if he was already going to cast them into the abyss.&nbsp;
Christ's order was enough, they humbly obeyed Jesus: they left the possessed
man at once.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This same case
happened with Satan during Jesus' temptation.&nbsp; Christ did not have
to struggle with Satan so that he would leave.&nbsp; Jesus only had to
order Satan to get out, and Satan obeyed promptly and humbly; he knew he
could not do anything else before a divine being as Jesus is.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A very different
picture is seen in the case of Michael.&nbsp; The archangel had to contend,
had to struggle with Satan.&nbsp;<b> It is more than evident that Jesus
and Michael are not the same person.</b>&nbsp; <b>Michael could not order
Satan to leave; he had to struggle with him</b>.&nbsp; Michael even needed
peers to help him in his struggle.&nbsp; On the other hand, Jesus alone,
by himself, was more than enough to put Satan in his place, he did not
need any help.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No real Christian,
who knows that Christ is divine, is going to accept that Jesus "durst not
" or had to "contend" with the Devil.&nbsp; Satan is no match at all for
Jesus.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Satan found it
impossible to destroy Christianity from the outside.&nbsp; He could not
destroy Christianity with persecutions and tortures.&nbsp; This is why
he infiltrates it and tries to destroy it from the inside out.</font>
