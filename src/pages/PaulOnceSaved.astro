<p><strong>Let's see how Paul says that those who tasted the heavenly gift and were partakers of the Holy Spirit, later
    went astray</strong></p>
<p>��� This passage below (Heb 6:4-6) is a clear declaration of the possibility of losing salvation on the part of the
    believers. Let us analyze it.</p>
<p>��� <strong>Paul is unquestionably talking about those who "were once enlightened; tasted the heavenly gift, and were
    partakers of the Holy Spirit".</strong> We don't need to give it much thought to realize that the person that
    satisfies those requirements is nothing less but a saved person, a born-again person, a Christian. I don't see a way
    of twisting things to make it seem that a person who has been enlightened, who has tasted the heavenly gift, who
    <strong>has been a partaker of the Holy Spirit</strong>, who has tasted the good word of God and the virtues of the
    coming age, is not yet a Christian, has not yet been born again.</p>
<p>��� Furthermore, by saying that they "<strong>fell again</strong>" we can clearly see that they had gone away from
    sin, by the grace of God, and they fell into it <strong>again</strong>. Well, according to Paul, some of them went
    astray. In other words, they were once saved, and now they are not. <strong>It is to say that they had to be renewed
        again, therefore they had been renewed before</strong>. Let's see.</p>
<p>��� "4 <i>For it is impossible for <strong>those who were once</strong> <strong>enlightened</strong>, and <strong>have
    tasted of the heavenly gift</strong>, and <strong>were made partakers of the Holy Ghost</strong>,</i> <i>5 <strong>and
    have tasted the good word of God</strong>, and <strong>the powers of the world to come</strong>,</i> <i>6 <strong>if
    they shall fall away</strong>, to renew them <strong>again</strong> unto repentance; seeing they crucify to
    themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame</i>." (Heb 6:4-6)</p>
<p>��� Well, these whole Christians fell away, as indicated in verse 6; and they shall not receive another opportunity,
    for in order to do that, Jesus would have to be crucified once more, and that is inadmissible.</p>
<p><strong>And, I dare add</strong>, I am sure that he who was saved on the first crucifixion, and fell again, once
    saved again through a second crucifixion of Jesus, he would fall once more; for if he didn't think much of the first
    crucifixion, which he believed to be the only one, much less would he consider the second one, being sure there
    would be a third, and even a fourth. Therefore, taking into account human behavior, it is nothing but logical not to
    repeat the Lord's crucifixion, and he who falls away from the faith must pay the consequences.</p>
<p>��� <strong>Some believers of this heresy, "once saved always saved", in order to get out of the bind</strong> that
    this passage puts them in, claim that here Paul doesn't say that the Christian can fall, but it is rather a
    rhetorical question, in which he says that, "even if someone were to fall from grace, Christ would not be crucified
    again".</p>
<p>��� <strong>Well, first</strong>, Paul is <strong>not</strong> asking a question, but making a statement. Neither did
    the Holy Spirit ask a rhetorical question, but a categorical declaration. <strong>Second,</strong> if a Christian
    cannot fall, under any circumstances, if that were absolute and totally impossible, it would be illogical for Paul
    to talk about it. It would be useless to warn that there would not be a second crucifixion, because it would not be
    needed, no one would ever fall.� It would be like <strong>warning a pedestrian on the paved streets of his city, to
        be careful not to be bitten by a shark that is wandering the streets.</strong> It is illogical to attribute such
    senseless words to an inspired man, like Paul, warning of a danger that he very well knew, did not exist.</p>
<p>��� Besides everything already said, we know that <strong>Paul knew how to present hypothetical examples he did not
    believe; and he did it as to not to leave room for doubt that it was hypothetical.</strong> Such hypothetical
    example we find in Gal 4:15, where he says that, if possible, you would pluck out your eyes to give to me. In other
    words, he knew how to use the hypothetical language without leaving doubt that it was indeed hypothetical; and
    evidently, here in Heb. 6:4-6 he is not using it. Therefore it is clear that Paul is not speaking hypothetically but
    real; he is not asking a rhetorical question, but rather making a statement, giving <strong>a serious
        warning</strong>.</p>
<p>��� <strong>Who falls back?</strong> The Lord God knows that the human being is weak, and thus He has provided the
    opportunity to repent. No, repentance is not lip service, it is heartfelt. When a Christian sins out of weakness, or
    a very strong temptation, or trying to be holy without God's help, or out of ignorance, or trying to face temptation
    without divine help, etc., and falls, but is sorry that he did, and <strong>repents truly</strong>, such Christian
    has not to fear of losing his salvation. That is precisely why Jesus died. This is proven by Peter's sin. But note
    his repentance: <strong>he wept bitterly</strong>.</p>
<p>��� Such is not the case of him who sins and <strong>does not weep bitterly</strong>, because he does not love the
    Lord and therefore is not sorry for the betrayal, <strong>he is just using Jesus to be saved.</strong> This type of
    religious individual believed that Christ was his savior and his past sins had been forgiven; but he does not hate
    sin, on the contrary, he loves sin more than he loves Christ; that is why his sin draws him away from God, because
    he loves his sin more than he loves the Lord.</p>
<p>��� <strong>Those who sin and are not sorry of having sinned, those who sin and think they have to be forgiven,
    because we are under grace</strong>, are the same that little by little harden themselves. Their love for sin is
    such that they feel no guilt. They walk all over Jesus, they hold in contempt the blood of the covenant, <strong>by
        which he has been made whole</strong>, and despise the <strong>Spirit of grace</strong>. It is those of whom
    Paul talks about as having but a horrible hope or judgment and fire. Make no mistake, brethren, the sacrifice of
    Jesus Christ is holy and we cannot play with it the game of "sin-and-go-repent, but I sin again because I love it",
    and <strong>you have to forgive me, because I believe with all my faith, that once saved always saved"</strong>.</p>
<p>��� <strong>Now, no Christian should think that falling back</strong> is about just any sin. In I John 5:16 we see
    the apostle John mention prayers in favor of a brother that has committed a "<strong>sin not of death</strong>". Any
    sin that, after it is committed, causes a deep pain in the soul of a believer, is a forgivable sin.</p>
<p>��� The Lord, conscious of the moral and spiritual filth of the human soul, has provided a shock absorber between our
    actual salvation and the abyss of eternal damnation. Not because we just cross the limits of holiness we are
    immediately going to fall into the abyss. However, if we fall too far away from the limit, and we get ourselves more
    and more into the dark muffling zone, we may very well run into the abyss, before we can see it and turn back,
    because our eyes are callused by the sin and we can't see the abyss.</p>
<p>��� It is as if the path of holiness in our lives were lined by a muffling zone on each side; and just ahead of that
    muffling zone, on each side, is the sinuous lining of the horrendous and treacherous abyss. <strong>If we go down
        the right path that the Lord has set for us humans, we have no risk</strong>. However, if every now and then we
    go astray from the path, only to return immediately, we have little risk. But if we make it a habit to walk down the
    muffling zone, without never really going down the right path, we are almost certain we will fall into the abyss of
    eternal damnation.</p>
<p>��� If I were to show what I'm saying graphically, I would draw the figure that follows as a straight path, a
    muffling zone on both sides and an abyss of eternal damnation a little further, all seen from above:</p>

<p></p>
<p>��� Anyone who, like person "A", goes on the God instructed way, without wavering, is never in danger. Others like
    person "B" who sometimes wavers, but repents and turns back, is not at a lot of risk; only if the segments "D" or
    "E" along the way meet up with points "F" or "G" on the spiritual sphere, can he be lost forever. However, person
    "C", who has gotten used to walking on the cushion zone, sooner or later will fall into the ravine: if he avoids it
    in "H" he will fall in "I".</p>
