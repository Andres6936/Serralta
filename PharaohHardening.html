of Pharaoh: Heavenly Dynamics, Predestination and Free Will.</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did God force
Pharaoh to sin?&nbsp; Did God violate Pharaoh's free will?&nbsp; Did God
make Pharaoh hard?&nbsp; How did God harden Pharaoh without attempting
against his free will?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"<i>And the LORD said unto Moses: 'When thou goest to return into Egypt,
see</i></font>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine
hand;</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
but <b>I will harden his heart</b>, that he shall not let the people go.'</font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">
" ( Ex 4: 21 )</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>In this passage
God says very clearly that He will harden Pharaoh's heart.</b>&nbsp; Do
humans have free will?&nbsp; Is this case an exception?&nbsp; No, there
was no exception in this case.&nbsp; <b>Pharaoh kept his free will all
along this episode.&nbsp; The explanation for all this seeming paradox
is to realize <u>what was the method</u> God used to harden Pharaoh.&nbsp;</b>
This case serves to demostrate that we should not set doctrines based on
just a verse, a chapter, a passage or even a book of the Bible.&nbsp; Our
doctrines have to be in harmony with the whole teachings of Bible, not
only a section of it.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Let's imagine
that Moses come before Pharaoh and said</b>:&nbsp; "God is going to strike
lightning near you.&nbsp; After that, you are going to suffer from a headache
which will grow worse, and worse, and worse until you let the people leave".

<b>Let's suppose that the lightning strikes beside Pharaoh and that he
started to suffer horribly from a growing headache.</b>&nbsp; How long
do you think Pharaoh would refuse to let the people go?&nbsp; Two hours,
four hours, twelve hours?</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God could have
used this method, but if He would have, Pharaoh would not have hardened
is heart for more than a few hours; but this was not God's plan.&nbsp;
In this case it would not had made any sense to send the plagues, nor would
it demonstrate the evil of Pharaoh.&nbsp; It was necessary to send mild
and time limited plagues to Pharaoh, so that he could get the wrong idea
that God was weak and not very smart. <b>That way Pharaoh would harden
himself without God forcing his free will.</b>&nbsp; The same thing would
have happened if God would have sent him an asthma attack that grew worse
and worse every hour till he let the people go.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>When the first
plague came, which was to convert the water into blood</b>, it only lasted
for seven days;&nbsp; the Egyptians dug wells in a haste near the river,
and were able to have access to drinkable water.&nbsp; If God would have
caused the water of the wells to become blood&nbsp; and the plague to continue
indefinitely, Pharaoh would have surrendered.&nbsp; Even his generals,
soldiers and the people, who were going to be dying of thirst with their
children, would had forced him to let the people go.&nbsp; Something similar
happened in Ex 10: 7-8, where Pharaoh had to step down from his former
position, because his servants were ready to start a mutiny.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"<i>And Pharaoh's servants said unto him: 'How long shall this man be a
snare</i></font>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
unto us? <b>Let the men go that they may serve the LORD their God. Knowest
thou</b></font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
not that Egypt is destroyed?</b>' And Moses and Aaron were brought again
unto</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pharaoh, and he said unto them: 'Go, serve the LORD your God, but who are
they</font></i>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
that shall go?'</i> "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Ex 10: 7-8 )</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did God use a
harsh, radical, strong, unbearable method to break Pharaoh down?&nbsp;
No, on the contrary, God used mild, short lasting, seemingly weak methods,
which gave Pharaoh the foolish hope that he could deceive and overcome
God.&nbsp; Let's take a look at how God dealt with Pharaoh and the situation:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Instead of
ordering Pharaoh by means of lightnings, thunders and earthquakes to release
the people, God, through Moses, asked him softly to let the people go.
And what was Pharaoh's reaction? To grow haughtier and oppress the people
even more.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"<i>And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh: 'Thus saith
the</i></font>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
LORD God of Israel: Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me
in</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the wilderness'. And Pharaoh said: <b>'Who is the LORD that I should obey
his</b></font></i>
<br><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel
go'</i>."</font></b>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Ex 5: 1-2)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"<i>And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and</i></font>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
their officers, saying: <b>'Ye shall no more give the people straw to make
brick,</b></font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves. And the tale
of the</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
bricks,which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall
not</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
diminish ought thereof:&nbsp; for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying,
Let us go</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and sacrifice to our God'.</font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Ex 5: 6-8 )</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this order
against God's plans, nothing happened to Pharaoh.&nbsp; <b>He probably
thought that God was not powerful enough.</b>&nbsp; His thoughts could
have been:&nbsp; "I am Pharaoh; if someone dares to treat me with disdain
as I have treated that God, I would have them crushed and grinded.&nbsp;
If that God was powerful He would have crushed me already, since He hasn't,
he must not be powerful."</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) What was God's
next step?&nbsp; <b>It was not an action to demonstrate His power,</b>
but instead, something mild; something that He knew Egyptian magicians
could imitate with their tricks, therefore allowing Pharaoh think that
he had the same powers as God's representatives.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"<i>And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying: When Pharaoh
shall</i></font>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
speak unto you, saying: 'Shew a miracle for you', then thou shalt say unto
Aaron:</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
'Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh', and it shall become a serpent.
And</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
commanded; and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants,</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and it became a serpent. Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the
sorcerers:</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their
<u>enchantments</u>.</b></font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents. But Aaron's
rod</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
swallowed up their rods. <b>And He hardened Pharaoh's heart</b>, that he
hearkened not</font></i>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
unto them; as the LORD had said</i>."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Ex 7: 8-13 )</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>No one can
create matter, ( especially living creatures ) except God Himself.</b>&nbsp;
Satan, demons and their representatives on Earth can not create matter,
or a snake or any other living creature.&nbsp; What these magicians did
was the same thing that we see in theaters.&nbsp; Have you ever seen a
magician who cracks and drops two eggs into a hat and brings out two pigeons?&nbsp;
The Egyptian magicians were not going to tell Pharaoh that it was just
a trick; they would make him believe that they created those snakes. 
&nbsp;
<b>Pharaoh must have thought that he was not going to give up, because
he had at his disposal almost the same power that Israelites' God had.&nbsp;</b>
It is obvious that it was after this episode of the snakes that Pharaoh
hardened his heart.&nbsp; After each step, after each apparent victory
he achieved, he hardened his heart.&nbsp; God did not harden him, He just
acted in such a way that Pharaoh, who was an evil person, could think that
he could win after all, and overcome God.&nbsp; It was enough to harden
him.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) <b>The third
step was to turn their waters into blood&nbsp;</b> ( Ex 7:15-18 ).&nbsp;
When Pharaoh saw that his magicians did something similar, ( probably with
dyes ), and especially when he saw that he could escape thirst, he hardened
his heart again ( 7: 22 ).</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless
the miracle of Moses and the "miracle" of the magicians was not the same.&nbsp;
They&nbsp; "changed" a vessel full of water into "blood",&nbsp; rather
into something that looked like it.&nbsp; Moses changed the water of the
Nile River and all ponds, into real blood, as God worked through Moses.
Remember that the Nile River is the second or third largest in the world
in volume of water.&nbsp; It was meant to turn millions of tons of water
into real blood for a week, and to kill millions of fish.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) <b>Later came
the frogs</b> ( 8: 6 ).&nbsp; The magicians with their tricks could bring
more frogs, but they could not get rid of them.&nbsp; The frogs were a
real pain in the neck, so Pharaoh decided to humble himself a little and
made a false covenant with Moses.&nbsp; You get rid of the frogs, and I'll
let you go. <b>Once the plague was taken out Pharaoh would think like this:</b></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now who is going
to force me to fulfill my word?&nbsp; Let me back off to see what happens".
Pharaoh did not let the people go, but <b>the plague did not come back</b>.&nbsp;
Pharaoh's thought was probably more or less the following: "<b>This God
is not very strong, because He could not bring back the plague.</b>&nbsp;
He is not very smart either because He believed my lies, He did not ask
for any warranty.&nbsp; Besides I have noticed that <b>He can not repeat
the same plague</b>, nor can He keep it for long.&nbsp; <b>After a while
He will be out of plagues</b>.&nbsp; He cannot read my thoughts, because
he believed my promise and did not know that I was not planning&nbsp; to
accomplish my promise.&nbsp; I think I can overcome Him, and then, I will
become a famous king&nbsp; and in addition I will keep my invaluable slaves.&nbsp;
It is worth fighting for.&nbsp; Maybe I can discover some other weakness
in this God, and win Him over".</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course all
these examples are hypothetical, but very close to what Pharaoh was probably
actually thinking.&nbsp; <b>Every time that he hardened his heart it was
because he felt he won an apparent victory.</b>&nbsp; When the magicians
gave up ( Ex 8:19 ), Pharaoh already had thought he had won enough partial
victories so as to believe he could fight and overcome God.&nbsp; As a
result of Pharaoh's so called victorious thoughts, he became more arrogant.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>God had harden
Pharaoh's heart, but not by changing his personality or feelings, instead
by allowing Pharaoh to have apparent victories, and as a result God not
demonstrating all His power.</b></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is easy to
guess the sequence of the steps that led Pharaoh to harden his heart to
the point of loosing his life in the Red Sea.&nbsp; After the magicians
collapsed, he tried again by deceiving" God by promising to let the people
go as soon as the flies were taken away.&nbsp; The flies were taken away,
but Pharaoh refused again to let the Hebrews go.&nbsp; When all the Egyptian
cattle died, and Israelite's didn't, Pharaoh probably planned to confiscate
Israelite's cattle as soon as he overcame God, or as soon as God&nbsp;
"became tired"&nbsp; and&nbsp; "left Egypt unto the place that He was before".&nbsp;
The other plagues probably followed the same pattern.</font>
<br><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God hardened
Pharaoh's and the Egyptians' hearts to the point where they continued to
follow God's people into the Red Sea.&nbsp; God did it by ordering Moses
to put the people in a dangerous position, and by making the Egyptians
realize that the Israelites were cornered; and that they did not have Israelite
servants anymore.</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
" <i>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying:&nbsp; 'Speak unto the children
of Israel,</i></font>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea,
over</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
against Baalzephon, before it shall ye encamp by the sea'.&nbsp; <b>For
Pharaoh will say</b></font></i>
<br><b><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of the children of Israel, 'They are entangled in the land, the wilderness
hath</font></i></b>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
shut them in.'</b>&nbsp; And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall
follow after them;</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians
may</font></i>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
know that I am the LORD. And they did so</i>."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Ex 14: 1- 4 )</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"<i>And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled; and <b>the
heart of <u>Pharaoh</u></b></i></font>
<br><b><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>and of his servants </u>was turned against the people, and they said:
'Why have we</font></i></b>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?</b>&nbsp; And he
made ready his</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
chariot, and took his people with him;&nbsp; And he took six hundred chosen
chariots,</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.&nbsp;
And the LORD</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children
of</font></i>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand</i>."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Ex 14: 5-8 )</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>God does not
take from us the free will which he gave us before.</b>&nbsp; It is evident
that God does not go against what He established before, but in His wisdom
uses various means to lead humans to accomplish His purposes.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>When God predestined
Pharaoh for all these events, He did not predestined him to be evil, hard
or arrogant</b>.&nbsp; He only predestined Pharaoh to be king of Egypt
in the moment that the Israelites were to leave Egypt, as we are told in
Ex 9:16.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"<i>And in very deed <b>for this cause have I raised thee up</b>, for to
shew in thee</i></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth</i>."
( Ex 9:16 )</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>God knows every
soul He has created. He sent a soul to the body of the baby who was going
to be born to the former pharaoh,</b> a soul that He knew was going to
become evil, hard and arrogant.&nbsp; That way, when that baby became the
king of Egypt, God could show His power to Israel and the world.&nbsp;
If that soul would had been sent to the body of a slave's son, that person
was going to be evil, hard and arrogant anyway, but he could not execute
evil against Moses.&nbsp; <b>It is evident that God predestines certain
souls to some place, circumstances and time, in order to execute His will.
God does not predestine a soul to be lost or saved, good or evil.</b></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclussion,
it is good to take into consideration, <b>that the magicians did not have
any supernatural power as many brethren think</b>.&nbsp; Many brothers
say that the magicians had satanic powers.&nbsp; No, they didn't.&nbsp;
The only satanic "powers"&nbsp; they had was the power to deceive.&nbsp;
They deceived their "public", in this case Pharaoh and his court.&nbsp;
If the magicians had any power, they would have protected Pharaoh from
the frogs.&nbsp; What I want to make very clear is that the Egyptian magicians
( Jannes and Jambres according to Paul in II Tim 3:8 ), did not have "satanic
powers" as many na&iuml;ve brothers think.&nbsp; Even Satan does not have
those creating&nbsp; "powers".&nbsp;&nbsp; The only satanic "power" that
the magicians had was to know how to deceive others.&nbsp; <b><u>Nobody
in this world has the power to create; only God has this power.</u></b></font><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font></b>
