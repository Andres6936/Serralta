<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:18.0pt'>HEAVENLY DYNAMIC<u8:p></u8:p></span></b> </p>

style='font-size:14.0pt'>Who are those who become obstacles, and how we let them<u8:p></u8:p></span></b>
</p>

<p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Christians
don't have a simple battle against flesh and blood, or in other words, humans
and their forces. Our true battle is against beings of another kind; beings
that have the gloomy principality of certain influences that move throughout
the earth; beings that have authority to influence, by seduction, over the men
who govern this planet, and by them, in these governments, against us. Beings
that tempt us constantly putting malignant ideas in our mind at times that we
must reject. </p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.2in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.2in;
margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>but against principalities, against powers,
against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness
in high places</b></i>.&quot;<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
(Eph 6:12) </p>

<p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
we not only battle against what we see, against the people who oppose or hurt
us. In a different dimension than the one we find ourselves open to, live
spiritual beings called angels; those who have faithfully followed God, just
like those who rebelled against Him. Those who have rebelled against Him, in
the Bible are called demons. </p>

<p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those
other rebellious beings (demons), attack us spiritually. They can't do any harm
to God, but rejoice in doing harm to his creatures. Why would they (the demons)
waist time on human beings that haven't been converted to the Lord or never
will? One who doesn't belong to God and don't know whether he will convert
later or not, they don't have to work as hard on, like the one who has already
slipped out of their hands, <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>like who,
for representing God, would be a privilege to make them stumble or fall</b>. </p>

<p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
more tenacious opposition and large numbers of enemies is why a Christian needs
to pray without ceasing, like what is said in I Tes 5:17. The Christian needs
to expose every situation to God, to give him the right to intervene in the
situation. </p>

<p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>If an unbeliever wanted to open a bar or a
brothel,</b> they won't find any difficulties other than those deriving from
human law and order that society regulates in any given city and those that
derive from human opposition; if anyone opposes. </p>

<p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>But if a Christian wants to open a church,</b>
he's going to encounter many difficulties from humans and demons. Not only will
he have the difficulties that derive from the law or order who regulate certain
things in society, but also the human opposition from those humans who don't
like such things. With the particularity that the human opposition will be
exacerbated by the agitation of souls that the spiritual enemies provoke in
those who oppose. Not only in those who oppose but also in others that they
wouldn't have been interested in opposing, but are now agitated in their
spirits. They will find, get ready, opposition from other Christians whose jealousness,
envies, interests, baseness, errors, etc., are used by the spiritual enemies to
put them, inexplicably, red hot. </p>

<p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
those types of deeds were not from God, they wouldn't be able to overcome those
difficulties. That's why we have to pray: to permit God to intervene in favor
of that work. That's why we have to be sure, before undertaking, to know that
it is a work of God. That's why we have to be patient; because some works that
may seem from God aren't now, but maybe further along in time&#8230;. And we
have to wait; because if you do it and you put in the effort, you will fail (II
Cr 25:8). <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>That's why we must obey all of
God's commandments, to put us in tune with heavenly things, to synchronize
ourselves, to coordinate with what is done in the heavenly sphere, were things
are planned to perfection, but counting on us to obey the layout given by God.</b>
The more we apart from our presupposed deeds, the less it will apply in the
preconceived plan in the heavenly sphere. </p>

<p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Let's suppose God wanted us to live in a
poor neighborhood</b>, where there was a house we could buy, which was situated
in a perfect place to use the gospel and influence the lives of people God
surrounded you with, to help change their lives. </p>

<p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
on the other side, we desire a better house in a different location, where
people won't be as receptive to the gospel. To God our desire to live better
doesn't seem bad, but what he does know is that you don't meet the requisites
needed to acquire credit for the better house, but you do for the other.
Therefore, he will answer the prayer we put in front of Him, in regard to
wanting to talk to people about the Gospel. </p>

<p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>If we do things like God orders us to in
his commandments, that prayer of giving us a place to fruitfully preach the
gospel, you will find an answer, but if we allow ourselves to be tempted, it
will spoil. How? <u8:p></u8:p></b></p>

<p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
like the second house, which is understandable; but when it comes time to
answer questions on the credit application, we say a few lies &quot;that aren't
so important&quot;, with the objective set at making the bank think that the
qualifications have been met and then&#8230; Boom! We leave with ours! They
approved our credit! We can buy the second house! </p>

<p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
thank God for what we think is &quot;a blessing&quot; and we occupy our new
home waiting for that old and continuous petition that God give us people to
share the gospel with, so they believe. Time passes and our fruit is poor,
lean. Then we share with our brothers in faith, the pronounce the same
clich&eacute; as always: &quot;it's a mystery, brother&quot;. If something bad
happens in the neighborhood then we'll use the other clich&eacute;, more stupid
than the other: &quot;it's a test from God, brother&quot;. </p>

<p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>When God answers our prayers, it's adjusted
to divine norms; if we separate ourselves from them, we separate ourselves from
his plan and his blessing.</b> The worse the breaking of the divine norms, the
bigger the detour of the plans of God, and less spiritual fruit obtained. </p>

<p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Below
we see a passage in which Paul tells a parable, which teaches us that doing
what God demands is to do justice, it's like using camouflage to protect
yourself from the enemy, and tell the truth, it's the shield that protects us
in combat, etc. </p>
