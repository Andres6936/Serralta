and the Virgin Mary</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prophecy in
Isa 7: 14 is a clear sign for every sincere seeker that Jesus is the Messiah.
The same thing can be said about the prophecy of the Seventy Weeks in the
book of Daniel. Jewish scholars reject this interpretation alleging that
the Hebrew word from which our word "virgin" is translated could mean both:
"a young lady" and "virgin".</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some "brilliant"
linguists and "experts", who teach in Christian seminars, use this same
argument.&nbsp; They are really more interested in showing adulation to
rabbis and ayatollahs , and in demonstrating to others that they are not
"fanatics" than in seeking the truth of God. Let's read that verse.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"<i>Therefore <b>the Lord himself shall give you a sign</b>; Behold, <b>a
virgin shall</b></i></font>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
conceive, and bear a son,</b> and shall call his name Immanuel</font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">."
( Isa 7: 14 )</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the word used
in Hebrew could <b>really</b> mean either "young lady" or "virgin", <b>then
it is evident from the context that the meaning to be translated has to
be "virgin"</b>.&nbsp; Why?</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The verse we
read says that <b>God Himself was going to give a sign.&nbsp; A sign is
something marvelous, something different from the usual.&nbsp; If a young
lady has a child this is no sign at all.</b>&nbsp; Almost all young ladies
have children.&nbsp; But if a virgin has a son, this of course, is a marvelous
sign.&nbsp; So, even, if the word in Hebrew can be translated either way,
our common sense tells us that "virgin" is the right choice.&nbsp; We don't
have to be "scholars", "linguists", "experts" or seminary professors; nor
even have to know any Hebrew;
<b>we just have to use our common sense.</b></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Then why do
scholars, experts, Christian seminary professors, and so on, accept and
spread such a mistake?</b>&nbsp; Do they not have common sense , or do
they want to confound Christianity?</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are others
who reject this prophecy by saying that verses 14-17 refer to Isaiah's
son, of whom is spoken in Isa 8: 3- 4.&nbsp; This is another manifestation
of flippancy or dishonesty from these "experts".&nbsp; If the sentence
"<i>Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son</i>" refers to Isaiah's
wife, <b>then they are accepting for her the virginal conception that formerly
they did not accept for the Virgin Mary.</b></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If on the other
hand, they do not say that Isaiah's wife gave birth to a child being a
virgin, then they have to conclude that God offered a sign, but it never
took effect.&nbsp; It wouldn't be a sign that Isaiah's wife conceived a
child; it is natural for most wives.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another argument
against this twisted interpretation of Muslims, Jews and some scholars
of Christian seminaries is that <b>even though both cases look alike, they
are not the same.&nbsp;</b> In the first case the son to be born (chapter
7 ) would be named&nbsp; "Immanuel",&nbsp; and in the second case (chapter
8 ) the son to be born would be named Mahershalalhashbaz .&nbsp; <b>Also
both names have very different meanings.</b> The name "Immanuel" means
"God with us", while the name "Mahershalalhashbaz" means "haste ye to the
spoil".&nbsp; The spirit of the first prophecy is peace; the spirit of
the second is punishment.&nbsp; <b>They are two different prophecies.</b></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also
seminary professors and&nbsp; "Christian" scholars who say that they are
in doubt whether this 7:14 prophecy refers to Virgin Mary or not.&nbsp;
Evidently they are scholars in everything else but the Bible, because&nbsp;
Matt&nbsp; 1: 21-23 says clearly that it refers to Virgin Mary.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I don't think that these scholars know better than Matthew or than the
Holy Spirit who inspired him.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"<i>And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS:
for he</i></font>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
shall save his people from their sins.&nbsp; Now <b>all this was done,
that it might be</b></font></i>
<br><b><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord <u>by the prophet</u>, saying:&nbsp;
Behold,</font></i></b>
<br><b><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>a virgin</u> shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son,</font></i></b><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">
and they shall call his</font></i>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us</i>."</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Matt&nbsp; 1: 21-23 )</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are those
seminary professors and scholars up to?&nbsp; Are they ignoramus or are
they trying to confound Christians, and destroy Christianity from inside
out?&nbsp; If Matthew says that this prophecy refers to&nbsp; Virgin Mary,
who are those arrogant and foolish scholars and professors to cast doubts
on it?</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is interesting
to think that Muslims and Jews do not want to admit that this prophecy
refers to Mary and Jesus, the Messiah, nevertheless, based on this truth
one of the world's major religions, Christianity, came about.&nbsp; This
is the same case with the prophecies in Isa 52:13- 53:12;&nbsp; Dan 9:
24 - 27 and&nbsp; Hag 2: 6 - 9.</font>
