  thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, because <B> thou hast hid these
  things from the wise and prudent, and <U> hast revealed them unto
  babes</U></B>. </I> 26 <I> Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are those that maintain the hypothesis that between
verses 1 and 2 of the first chapter of Genesis, there is a span of time that
could be as large as millions of years. According to them, during those millions
of years there existed a creation previous to our own, which reached a
civilization of high technological achievement, and which self destructed
due to atomic power. &#191;How do they know this? &#191;How do they prove
this? <B> They simply declare it as dogma, and you better believe it: "...
because we say it and we know more than you" .</B>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is illogical to believe this, since according to the
verses where they claim to derive such absurdity, <B><U> the light</U>,&nbsp;
<U>the atmosphere or sky</U> and&nbsp; <U>the dry land</U></B>, were created
<B><U> after</U></B> such a period. <B> It is not logical to think that a
civilization developed <U> without light</U>, <U> without atmosphere</U>
and&nbsp; <U>without dry ground</U></B>. Verses 3, 8 and 9.

  were the first day.</I> 6 <I> And God said: Let there be a firmament in the

  <I> And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the

  morning were the second day. </I> 9 <I> And God said: <B> Let the waters
  under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land
  appear</B>; and it was so. </I> 10 <I> And God called the dry land Earth;
  and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Besides all this, <U> which should be enough
refutation</U></B>, there are those verses which say that <B> God created
the heavens and earth in six days</B>. If the heavens and earth were created
in six days, there is not enough time on that Earth, that is to say, on this
planet, for a previous creation and also that supposed technological
"civilization" which some delirious dreamers imagine. To see that the heavens
<B> and the Earth</B> were created in only six days, it is enough to read
Gen 2: 1-2, Ex 20: 11, y 31: 17.

  work which he had made</I>." ( Gen 2: 1-2 )

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the arguments forwarded by the creators of this
erroneous hypothesis is the phrase: "... and the Earth was formless and void".
According to them God would not create the Earth to be in this state. But
it happens that in Jer 4:23 an equivalent phrase is used, and this would
not be reason enough to conclude that God had created the Earth so that it
be without form and void. In the King James English translation the exact
same phrase is used in both verses.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, if we admit that what is spoken of in Nahum
1:9 means that sin and affliction will not arise twice, it would refute this
hypothesis, since it affirms that sin, and specially affliction would have
already risen twice.

<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To summarize</B>, there is no lapse of millions of
years between Gn 1:1 and Gn 1:2, and thus, the so-called "Gap theory" is
absurd.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are those that for the purpose of drawing disciples
behind them are capable of making up any fable. Absurd fables that unfortunately
are swallowed by many good brothers, who go out and spread them, without
realizing the damage they cause. If this were not such a serious issue, it
would be such that, once they explained their absurd hypothesis, we would
say to them: "Now tell us about Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, or how about
Little Red Riding Hood".
