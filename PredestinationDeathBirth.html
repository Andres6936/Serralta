<p align=center style='text-align:center;tab-stops:.25in'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>PREDESTINATION, DEATH OF HEZEKIAH, THE
USE OF CONTRACEPTIVES, DOCTORS AND INSURANCE<u8:p></u8:p></span></b> </p>

<p style='tab-stops:.25in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
are many people who believe everything is predestined with exactness; the year,
month, day, hour, minute, second, and above all else, the day of our death and
our birth. <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The truth of the matter is
that these people think they believe such a thing, <u>but in reality they don't</u></b><u>.</u>
</p>

<p style='tab-stops:.25in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
the following passage, we will notice that <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>the
day of Hezekiah's death <u>was not</u> predestined</b>, since his death was
postponed fifteen years after the king prayed unto the Lord. If he was
predestined to die in the epoch Isaiah announced his death; his life would not
have been extended fifteen more years. And if he were predestined to die after
the fifteen years, his death would not have been announced for the time Isaiah
did. Otherwise, he would have been prophesizing a lie. </p>

<p style='tab-stops:.25in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Some fanatic could allege</b> that his
death was predestined for when Isaiah announced his death, but then God changed
his predestination and predestined it to be fifteen years later. In this case,
the fanatic is using a euphemism (something commonly done by those who back
errors) by saying something is predestined when it is not predestined. <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u>Predestination is immutable</u>. If
predestination were not immutable, then Janseno-Calvinist
&quot;predestination&quot; of salvation, wouldn't be predestination either</b>.
</p>

<p style='tab-stops:.25in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.2in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.2in;
margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;tab-stops:.25in'>&quot;1 <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>In
those days was Hezekiah sick unto death</i></b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto
him:<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'> Thus saith the LORD: Set thine
house in order, for <u>thou shalt die, and not live</u></b>. </i>2<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the
wall, and prayed unto the LORD. </i>3<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> And
said: Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in
truth and with perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight.
And Hezekiah wept sore. </i>4<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> Then came
the word of the LORD to Isaiah saying: </i>5<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>
Go, and say to Hezekiah: Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father: I
have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears, <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>behold I will add unto thy days fifteen years</b></i>.&quot; ( Isa 38:
1-5 ) </p>

<p style='tab-stops:.25in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
reality, <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>those who say they believe in
predestination do not believe in such a thing</b>. They struggle to
auto-convince themselves that they believe, when in reality they don't.
Predestinationists believe that <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>the
moment of <u>our death</u> like the moment of <u>our birth</u> is predestined</b>.
Nevertheless, they go to the doctors to cure themselves, instead of leaving it
all up to what God has predestined. </p>

<p style='tab-stops:.25in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
same occurs with childbearing. They all say they believe in predestination, yet
they use contraceptive methods so they do not have children every nine months. <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>If they believed in predestination, they
wouldn't use contraceptive methods</b>, since what is going to happen has
already been written. If they were predestined to have a child, they are going
to have that child, even if they use contraceptive methods. On the contrary, if
they were predestined not to have a child, they shouldn't use contraceptive
methods. It should not be necessary. They use contraceptive methods even so
proving that in the depths of their soul, they do not believe in
predestination. </p>

<p style='tab-stops:.25in'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>If their house were predestined <u>not</u>
to be set on fire,</b> it would not be ignited in any way. Consequently, they
should not be wasting their money on this type of insurance. If it were
predestined for their illness to be cured, they wouldn't have to go to the
doctor. If their illness was <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u>not </u></b>to
be cured, then the doctor can do nothing for them. So why do they go to the
doctor? As you can see, <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>predestinationists
<u>suppose</u> they believe in predestination, yet in reality, in the depths of
their souls, they <u>do not believe in predestination</u>. <u8:p></u8:p></b></p>
