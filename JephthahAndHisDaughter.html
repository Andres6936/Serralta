<center><b><font size=+2>Jephthah did not offer his daughter in sacrifice</font></b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Years ago it was published that Jephthah, one of
the judges of Israel, killed his daughter in a ceremonial human sacrifice.&nbsp;
It was published in the Sunday School's quarterly of one of the most important
Christian denominations.&nbsp; The article was published in pages 76-82
of the quarterly named&nbsp; "Bible Book Study for Adults" in its issue
of January, February and March 1990.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time I felt very sad because of the carelessness
displayed by the directors of the publishing department of that denomination.
This publication influenced millions of Christians, that were led to error
by the author of that Sunday School lesson.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The author of that article was talking about Judges
11: 29-31
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>"</b><font size=-2>29
</font><i>Then
the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gilead, and Manasseh,
and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of Gilead he passed over
unto the children of Ammon. </i><font size=-2>30 </font><b><i>And Jephthah
vowed</i></b>
<br><i><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a vow unto the LORD,</b>
and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ammon into mine hands,
</i><font size=-2>31
</font><i>then
it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doors of my house to
meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon,</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>shall surely be
the LORD'S</u>, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering</b></i><b>."</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Judges 11: 29-31 )
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jephthah's vow <b>was not a promise to kill </b>the
first one of his household who met him after his victorious return.&nbsp;
He did not promise to burn that person in the fire of a pagan altar. 
<b>His
vow was to <u>dedicate entirely</u> to God</b> anyone who met him first
after his victory over the sons of Ammon.&nbsp; He promised to dedicate
that person entirely to God, as it was done with a lamb in a burnt offering.&nbsp;
The priests took their share from almost all sacrifices, except from burnt
offerings,
<b>because it was entirely for God</b>.&nbsp; In this vow, the
person was going to be dedicated entirely to God, as a lamb in a burnt
sacrifice. Jephthah's daughter became sort of a cloistered nun, with the
exception that she was not in seclusion; she could have normal social relations,
except marriage.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of his daughter, who happened to be
the one who met him first, the promise was to dedicate her entirely to
God.&nbsp; He consecrated her to God in such a way that she would not even
marry, because a married woman has to dedicate herself mostly to her husband
and children.&nbsp; <b>In that sense she was going to be dedicated to God
as a burnt offering.</b>&nbsp; Remember, burnt offerings were burned completely.&nbsp;
In other types of offerings, the priests could eat some of its meat, but
in the burnt offerings they could not take anything, because it was all
offered to God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can see a similar dedication in the case of Samuel.&nbsp;
His mother Hannah offered him to the Lord forever without reserving anything
of her child for her.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<i>And
<b>she
vowed a vow,</b> and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the affliction of
thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; handmaid, but wilt give
unto thine handmaid a man child, <b>then I will give him</b></i>
<br><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unto the LORD <u>all
the days of his life</u>,</i></b><i> and there shall no razor come upon
his</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; head</i>."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( I Sam 1: 11 )
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<i>For
this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of him. Therefore also
<b>I
have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be</b></i>
<br><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lent to the LORD</i></b>."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( I Sam 1: 27-28 )
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In dedicating his daughter completely to God, Jephthah
was depriving his only child from marriage.&nbsp; <b>In doing this he was
giving up his only possibility of having descendants</b>.&nbsp; This was
the reason for his great anguish expressed in Judges 11: 35, when he realized
that his daughter was the one that met him first.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;
"</i><font size=-2>34 </font><i>And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house,
and, behold, his daughter came</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out to meet him with
timbrels and with dances: and <b>she was his only child</b>; beside</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her he had neither son
nor daughter. 35 And it came to pass, when he saw her, that</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>he rent his clothes,
and said: Alas, my daughter! Thou hast brought me very low,</b></i>
<br><i><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and thou art one of
them that trouble me</b>; for I have opened my mouth unto the</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LORD, and I cannot go
back."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Jdg 11: 34-35 )
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several passages that tell us plainly that
Jephthah's vow had nothing to do with killing anyone.&nbsp; Let us mull
over those passages, to get the correct idea.&nbsp; If we read Jdg 11:
36-39 we see that the worry was not about the young lady's life or death,
but about her virginity and the forgoing of her marriage.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<font size=-2>36
</font><i>And
she said unto him: My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LORD, <b>do to me according
to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth;</b></i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forasmuch as the LORD
hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the children of Ammon.
</i><font size=-2>37
</font><i>And
she said unto her father: Let this thing be done</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for me: let me alone
two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains,</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and bewail my virginity,
I and my fellows. </i><font size=-2>38 </font><i>And he said, Go. And he
sent her</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; away for two months:
and she went with her companions, <b>and bewailed her</b></i>
<br><i><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; virginity</b> upon
the mountains. </i><font size=-2>39 </font><i>And it came to pass at the
end of two months,</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that <b>she returned
unto her father, who <u>did with her according to his vow</u> which</b></i>
<br><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he had vowed: and
<u>she
knew no man</u></i></b>."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Jdg 11: 36-39 )
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we can see in verse 36, Jephthah's daughter asked
her father to <b>do to her according to what he vowed.</b>&nbsp; Therefore,
her petition, must follow what he vowed.&nbsp; And what was that followed?&nbsp;
In verse 37, we see that this young lady just asked to <b>bewail her virginity.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidently, her life was not at stake, because it
would be very silly to bewail for her virginity if she was going to be
killed.&nbsp; Should she be in peril of loosing her life, she was going
to bewail for her life and not for her virginity.&nbsp; Virginity was a
very secondary matter at the face of death.&nbsp; It was idle and exceedingly
foolish to bewail for something ( virginity ) that after death was good
for nothing, and not bewailing for her life without which everything else
was useless.&nbsp; Why lament that she was never to have a marriage, if
she was going to die and have nothing? All this tells us that the only
thing she knew she was going to loose was marriage.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In verse 39 we see that as a consequence drawn from
everything previously narrated, it says:&nbsp; "…<i>she returned unto her
father,
<b>who did with her according to his vow</b> which he had vowed:
<b>and
she knew no man</b></i>."&nbsp; Thus, after her return, <b>her father did
<u>according
to his vow</u></b>, and as a consequence of doing according to his vow,&nbsp;
"…<b><i>she knew no man</i></b>".&nbsp; It is perfectly clear that Jephthah's
vow was not to kill and burn anyone, but to dedicate to God the first one
who met him after his victory.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this virgin was going to be killed after her
two months lamentation period, it would be exceedingly idle for the writer
of this chapter to later underscore that she never had sexual relations
with a man.&nbsp; Of course, if she was killed it was not necessary to
say that she knew no man; dead people have no sexual relations.&nbsp; So,
it is obvious that they are referring to a young lady that was kept alive,
but would not have sexual relations for the rest of her life.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Let us now use logic.&nbsp; Would God reward
with victory a person who is capable of sacrificing human beings?&nbsp;</b>
God granted victory to Jephthah after his vow.&nbsp; If his vow was a human
sacrifice, which was strictly forbidden and punished with death by the
law of God; would God grant him victory?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In verse 29 it says that the Spirit of the Lord
came upon Jephthah.&nbsp; Would the Holy Spirit be upon such a horribly
confused religious murderer?&nbsp; He wouldn't be, of course.&nbsp; If
Jephthah promised to kill and burn a human being the Holy Spirit was not
going to be upon him.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<i>Then
<b>the
Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah,</b> and he passed over Gilead,</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Manasseh, and passed
over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; passed over unto the
children of Ammon</i>."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Jdg 11: 29 )
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This same reasoning can be made after reading Heb
11: 32.&nbsp; There, <b>Paul commended Jephthah among several other biblical
heroes.</b>&nbsp; I don't think that if Jephthah killed and burned his
daughter in a pagan altar, Paul was going to use him as a good example
to be imitated by Christians.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<i>And
what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of Barak, and of Samson,
<b>and
of Jephthah</b>; of David also, and Samuel, and of the</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prophets</i>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Heb 11: 32 )
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Jephthah was such a religious ignorant person
that did not know that human sacrifices were forbidden by God, he was not
a good model that Paul could flag as a guide for Christians' behavior.&nbsp;
Paul was not going to commend an idolatrous pagan daughter murderer.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore it shows that Jephthah was not such a
religious ignorant leader as he is depicted in the quarterly I mentioned
before.&nbsp; As we read&nbsp; Jdg 11: 14 - 28, we can learn how Jephthah
recited the history of Israel in great detail to the king of Ammon.&nbsp;
If he knew everything so well concerning Israel's history, are we going
to believe, as the quarterly says, that he did not know that God forbade
human sacrifices?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is very clear that Jephthah never promised to
kill the one who met him first.&nbsp; It is clear that the young lady bewailed
for her virginity, not for her life.&nbsp; It is clear that the Holy Spirit
was not going to be upon Jephthah if he was an idolatrous murderer.&nbsp;
It is clear that Paul was not going to commend Jephthah if he had killed
and burned his daughter in a pagan altar.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, <b><u>it is obvious</u> that what Jephthah
promised was to dedicate his daughter entirely to God</b>, just as a burnt
offering was dedicated entirely to God without letting the priests eat
any part of the sacrifice.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is my desire that those who are in high quarters
be more watchful, to avoid the sheep under their care be misled by writers
that do not exercise good judgment of biblical interpretation.
