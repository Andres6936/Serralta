        <p>If you want the book "Daniel 7: The Last Four World Powers " , just ask for it,
            and we will send it to you free of charge. The address is available at the end
            of this page. This is a book in which for the first time it is demonstrated with
            facts the true interpretation of the Daniel 7 prophecy and how it is being
            fulfilled before our eyes. The four beasts of the prophecy really represent
            England , Russia , China and the European Union.</p>

        <p>This book will help you to understand that prophecy and help you teach it to the
            brethren under your spiritual responsibility; regarding such an important issue
            as is the Second Coming of Our Lord Jesus Christ.
            This book is not about a writer trying to twist the Bible so that the Scriptures
            agree with his interpretation of the prophecy. What the writer does is display
            before the readers' eyes what the media has published, so that they can check for
            themselves the reliability of the interpretation.</p>

        <p>The book is written in a very clear, pedagogical, and condensed manner. In this
            way you can absorb in a couple of hours, all its information just by reading it.
            You can trust that the time invested in reading this book will yield more than a
            hundred times your investment.</p>

        <p>You won't have to make yourself believe the interpretation; it will come to you
            just by reading .
            You will be able to prove that we are in the third of the four last steps of human
            history before the coming of Christ.</p>

        <p>"The author has the ability to impart his knowledge and experiences in a short
            and concise manner that is easy to understand. To put it in his own words let me
            share with you what he once told me: 'I do not dissolve an aspirin in a barrel of
            water, so as to force whoever wants the benefits of the aspirin, to drink the
            whole barrel. I just give them the aspirin. That's why I write as brief as
            possible'."</p>
