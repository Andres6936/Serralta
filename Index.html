            "The author has the ability to impart his knowledge and experiences in a short
            and concise manner that is easy to understand.  To put it in his own words let me
            share with you what he once told me: 'I do not dissolve an aspirin in a barrel of
            water, so as to force whoever wants the benefits of the aspirin, to drink the
            whole barrel.  I just give them the aspirin.  That's why I write as brief as
            possible'." <br><br>
