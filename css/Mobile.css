/*
Our current blog is a two-column layout, with a main content region and a
sidebar. The easiest way to make this more readable on a mobile browser is
to remove the floating elements so that the sidebar falls beneath the main
content. That way, the reader wonâ€™t have to scroll sideways on the device.
This is a dead-simple responsive design solution.
