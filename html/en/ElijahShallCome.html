            <p>It is said very clearly in the Bible that the Prophet Elijah, who never
                    died, will return a little before the Second Coming of Christ. In the
                    same way that the disciples in Jesus' time were confounded because
                    they didn't see Elijah coming before the Messiah (Christ), so many
                    modern Christians are confused believing that Elijah was John the
                    Baptist. This prophet was not Elijah, as he himself clearly states
                    in John 1: 21.</p>

                <p>"And they asked him, What then? <b>Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not.</b>"</p>

                <p>If John the Baptist really was Elijah he would not have denied it.
                    John the Baptist came in the spirit and power of Elijah,
                    as says Luke 1: 17, and that is why Jesus said that he was
                    "the Elijah" that was going to come before the Lord in his
                    First Advent. Nevertheless, even that Jesus himself said that
                    John the Baptist was the "Elijah-like" prophet that was to come
                    in his First Advent, still near the Second Coming of the Lord,
                    the true Elijah shall come again. Let us see what Jesus said
                    regarding that issue.</p>

                <p class="text-italic font-family-serif">"10 And his disciples asked him, saying: Why then say the
                    scribes that Elias
                    must first come? 11 And Jesus answered and said unto them, <b>Elias truly
                        <ins>shall</ins>
                        first come</b>, and restore all things. 12 But I say unto you, that Elias is
                    come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they
                    listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them. 13 Then the
                    disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist."
                    (Matthew 17: 10-13.)
                </p>

                <p>Everyone I know interprets from this passage that John the Baptist was the
                    Elijah that was prophesied. But as far as I know no one interprets
                    from that passage that <b>Jesus said clearly that Elijah shall come (future)
                        and shall restore (future again) all things.</b> Note that when referring
                    to the true Elijah, Jesus speaks in future tense (shall come; shall
                    restore), but when referring to John the Baptist he speaks in the past
                    tense (is come already; knew him not).
                    From this passage we can deduce, without forcing the argument, that
                    <b>Christ admitted that Elijah was yet to come.</b> But this is not all.
                    Let's go on to read the original prophecies; lets read Malachi 3:1,
                    where John the Baptist's mission during the First Coming of the Lord,
                    is prophesized, and later let's read Malachi 4: 5-6 where Elijah's
                    coming before the Second Coming of the Lord, is prophesized.</p>

                <p class="text-italic font-family-serif">"Behold, I will send <b>my messenger</b>, and he shall prepare
                    the way before me: and
                    <b>the Lord</b>, whom ye seek, <b>shall suddenly
                        <ins>come to his temple…</ins>
                    </b>" (Malachi 3:1)
                </p>

                <p>In this verse the one whose coming and mission Malachi is talking about <b>is
                    called "my messenger". He doesn't call him Elijah.</b> Besides, Malachi says
                    very clearly that the messenger's mission is to prepare the way before
                    Christ, and that <b>after such a
                        <ins>pacific mission</ins>
                        is that Christ would come
                        <ins>to his temple</ins>
                        .</b> The prophet talks of the "messenger" as a man who is
                    going to come during the time that Jesus would enter in the Second Temple.
                    <b>A messenger that was going to come in a time in which people
                        <ins>could still
                            enter in the Second Temple
                        </ins>
                    </b>, because it was not destroyed. (The Temple was
                    destroyed in year 70 AD).
                    This messenger didn't come in a mission of punishment, but in a mission
                    of announcing and preparing <b>the pacific First Coming of Our Lord.</b>
                    The other prophecy is very different. Let us see.
                </p>

                <p class="text-italic font-family-serif">"Behold, <b>I will send you Elijah the prophet</b> before the
                    coming of <b>the great
                        and
                        <ins>dreadful</ins>
                        day of the LORD.</b> He shall turn the heart of the fathers to
                    the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest <b>I
                        come and
                        <ins>smite the earth</ins>
                        with a curse.</b>" (Malachi 4: 5-6.)
                </p>

                <p>Here we see a very different picture. <b>
                    <ins>First</ins>
                </b> he calls the messenger by
                    his personal name, <b>he calls him Elijah.
                        <ins>Second</ins>
                    </b>, in order to avoid
                    any doubt he clarifies that he refers <b></b>to "the prophet", in case that
                    anyone could think of another Elijah.
                    <ins>Third</ins>
                </p>
                , Malachi specifies that
                <b>Elijah's mission is going to take place before the coming of the great
                    and
                    <ins>dreadful</ins>
                    day of the LORD.</b> That description does not depict the
                First Coming of Christ. His First Coming was an event extremely
                pacific, devoid of dramatics and dreadfulness, contrary to his Second
                Coming, which will be full of both dramatics and dreadfulness. In his
                First Coming, Christ didn't come to smite or destroy the earth, but
                instead to save it, to suffer for it. Therefore Malachi cannot be
                talking in this passage about John the Baptist during the First Coming
                of Christ, <b>but about Elijah before the Second Coming of the Lord.</b><br>
                By the study of both passages we can conclude that Malachi is
                talking about two different individuals who were going to have a
                similar mission ( to be forerunners), each one in very different
                times and circumstances. The first one is John the Baptist, in the
                time of Christ's First Coming; the second one is Elijah the Prophet,
                in latter times, near the Second Coming. When Jesus identifies John
                the Baptist in Matthew 11:10, he identifies him using the words found
                in Malachi 3:1, never the words used in Malachi 4: 5-6. Let's see:</p>

                <p class="text-italic font-family-serif">"For this is he, of whom it is written: 'Behold, I send <b>my
                    messenger</b> before
                    thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee'." (Matthew 11:10)</p>

                <p>This passage from Matthew confirms that it is Malachi 3:1 the one that
                    talks about John the Baptist and not Malachi 4:5-6.</p>
