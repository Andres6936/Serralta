        <h2>Elijah the prophet shall come before the Second Coming of the Lord</h2>
        <h4>Then, what about John the Baptist?</h4>
    </header>
    <article>
        <p>It is said very clearly in the Bible that the Prophet Elijah, who never
            died, will return a little before the Second Coming of Christ. In the
            same way that the disciples in Jesus' time were confounded because
            they didn't see Elijah coming before the Messiah (Christ), so many
            modern Christians are confused believing that Elijah was John the
            Baptist. This prophet was not Elijah, as he himself clearly states
            in John 1: 21.</p>

        <p>"And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not."</p>

        <p>If John the Baptist really was Elijah he would not have denied it.
            John the Baptist came in the spirit and power of Elijah,
            as says Luke 1: 17, and that is why Jesus said that he was
            "the Elijah" that was going to come before the Lord in his
            First Advent. Nevertheless, even that Jesus himself said that
            John the Baptist was the "Elijah-like" prophet that was to come
            in his First Advent, still near the Second Coming of the Lord,
            the true Elijah shall come again. Let us see what Jesus said
            regarding that issue.</p>

        <p>"10 And his disciples asked him, saying: Why then say the scribes that Elias
            must first come? 11 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall
            first come, and restore all things. 12 But I say unto you, that Elias is
            come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they
            listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them. 13 Then the
            disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist."
            (Matthew 17: 10-13.)</p>

        <p>Everyone I know interprets from this passage that John the Baptist was the
            Elijah that was prophesied. But as far as I know no one interprets
            from that passage that Jesus said clearly that Elijah shall come (future)
            and shall restore (future again) all things. Note that when referring
            to the true Elijah, Jesus speaks in future tense (shall come; shall
            restore), but when referring to John the Baptist he speaks in the past
            tense (is come already; knew him not).
            From this passage we can deduce, without forcing the argument, that
            Christ admitted that Elijah was yet to come. But this is not all.
            Let's go on to read the original prophecies; lets read Malachi 3:1,
            where John the Baptist's mission during the First Coming of the Lord,
            is prophesized, and later let's read Malachi 4: 5-6 where Elijah's
            coming before the Second Coming of the Lord, is prophesized.</p>

        <p>"Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and
            the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his templeâ€¦" (Malachi 3:1)</p>

        <p>In this verse the one whose coming and mission Malachi is talking about is
            called "my messenger". He doesn't call him Elijah. Besides, Malachi says
            very clearly that the messenger's mission is to prepare the way before
            Christ, and that after such a pacific mission is that Christ would come
            to his temple. The prophet talks of the "messenger" as a man who is
            going to come during the time that Jesus would enter in the Second Temple.
            A messenger that was going to come in a time in which people could still
            enter in the Second Temple, because it was not destroyed. (The Temple was
            destroyed in year 70 AD).
            This messenger didn't come in a mission of punishment, but in a mission
            of announcing and preparing the pacific First Coming of Our Lord.
            The other prophecy is very different. Let us see.</p>

        <p>"Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great
            and dreadful day of the LORD. He shall turn the heart of the fathers to
            the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I
            come and smite the earth with a curse." (Malachi 4: 5-6.)</p>

        <p>Here we see a very different picture. First he calls the messenger by
            his personal name, he calls him Elijah. Second, in order to avoid
            any doubt he clarifies that he refers to "the prophet", in case that
            anyone could think of another Elijah. Third, Malachi specifies that
            Elijah's mission is going to take place before the coming of the great
            and dreadful day of the LORD. That description does not depict the
            First Coming of Christ. His First Coming was an event extremely
            pacific, devoid of dramatics and dreadfulness, contrary to his Second
            Coming, which will be full of both dramatics and dreadfulness. In his
            First Coming, Christ didn't come to smite or destroy the earth, but
            instead to save it, to suffer for it. Therefore Malachi cannot be
            talking in this passage about John the Baptist during the First Coming
            of Christ, but about Elijah before the Second Coming of the Lord.
            By the study of both passages we can conclude that Malachi is
            talking about two different individuals who were going to have a
            similar mission ( to be forerunners), each one in very different
            times and circumstances. The first one is John the Baptist, in the
            time of Christ's First Coming; the second one is Elijah the Prophet,
            in latter times, near the Second Coming. When Jesus identifies John
            the Baptist in Matthew 11:10, he identifies him using the words found
            in Malachi 3:1, never the words used in Malachi 4: 5-6. Let's see:</p>

        <p>"For this is he, of whom it is written: 'Behold, I send my messenger before
            thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee'." (Matthew 11:10)</p>

        <p>This passage from Matthew confirms that it is Malachi 3:1 the one that
            talks about John the Baptist and not Malachi 4:5-6.</p>
