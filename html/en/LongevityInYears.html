                <p>People exist who are try to deny the fact that our first fathers (Adam, Seth,
                    etc.) used to live for centuries. They allege that the years mentioned in
                    those chapters are really "months" or "moons".<br>
                    <strong>The
                        <ins>only</ins>
                        base for their absurd hypothesis is</strong> that
                    if the number of years mentioned in the Bible for the
                    antediluvian patriarchs ages is divided by 12, the result is a number of years
                    <strong>"more acceptable"
                        <ins>to them</ins>
                        .</strong></p>

                <p>As an example they show that if 930 years, the biblical age of Adam,
                    is divided by 12 the quotient is 77 years.If Methuselah's age ( 969 ) is
                    divided by 12 months the quotient is almost 81 years, and so on.<br>
                    <strong>When human beings want to deny God, or the authority of the Bible, they
                        appeal to any nonsense, without using discernment, logic or scientific
                        methods.</strong> Mankind made up this hypothesis and clothed it with the cloak
                    of science.</p>

                <p><strong>These "enlightened ones"</strong> who thought they found the "explanation" of
                    the longevity of the patriarchs, didn't make any effort in reasoning even
                    superficially the issue. That's why they charged against this passage
                    wantonly and irresponsibly, thinking joyfully, that they have "discovered"
                    a flaw in the Scriptures or in its interpretations. That is why they
                    solemnly declare that in this passage the "so called" years, were just
                    "moons" or "months". They declare all this without noticing that before
                    their own eyes is the denial of their foolish hypothesis. Let us
                    read Gen 5: 3-17.</p>

                <blockquote class="text-italic font-family-serif">"3 <strong>And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years,
                    and begat a
                    son</strong> in his own likeness, after his image, and called his name Seth.
                    4 And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years; and
                    he begat sons and daughters. 5 And <strong>all the days that Adam lived were
                        nine hundred and thirty years</strong>; and he died.<br>

                    6 And <strong>Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos</strong>. 7 And Seth
                    lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and
                    daughters. 8 And <strong>all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years</strong>;
                    and he died.<br>

                    9 And <strong>Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan</strong>. 10 And Enos lived after he
                    begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters.
                    11 And <strong>all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years</strong>.
                    And he died.<br>

                    12 And <strong>Cainan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalaleel</strong>. 13 And Cainan
                    lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons
                    and daughters. 14 And <strong>all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten
                        years</strong>; and he died.<br>

                    15 And <strong>Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared</strong>. 16 And
                    Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and
                    begat sons and daughters. 17 And <strong>all the days of Mahalaleel were eight
                        hundred ninety and five years</strong>; and he died."

                    <cite>Gen 5: 3-17</cite>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Let's use a little math: 130 moons divided by 12 = 10.8 years; 105 moons
                    divided by 12 = 8.75 years; 90 moons divided by 12= 7.5 years; 70 moons
                    divided by 12 = 5.8 years; and 65 moons divided by 12= 5.41 years.</p>

                <p>If what these "enlightened ones" say is true, then Adam, according to
                    verse 3, had a son when he was almost eleven years old; Seth had his
                    first born when he was less than nine (verse 6); Enos when he was less
                    than eight (verse 9); Cainan when he was almost six years old, (verse 12);
                    and <strong>Mahaleel had a son when he was just
                        <ins>five and a
                            half
                        </ins>
                        years old</strong>, according to verse 15. <strong>As we can
                        see their hypothesis is absolutely illogical, and not scientific</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>It is evident that not everyone who claims to be a scientist or to use
                    scientific methods, is saying the truth. True science and true religion
                    have to coincide, because true science can only discover what God has
                    created, and true religion can say only what God said. What some people
                    forget is that when <strong>our first fathers were 500 years old, they were as
                        strong as an actual 35 or 40 years old man</strong>.</p>

                <p><strong>The saddest thing of all this is that "Christian leaders" exist who
                    believe these nonsensical hypothesis</strong>. Sure enough, many years ago I
                    was taken by surprise when my Sunday School teacher, <strong>who was a medical
                        doctor</strong> said: "With the knowledge I have of the human body I can assure
                    you that nobody can live that long". Immediately he went to the
                    blackboard and started to divide the total age of each patriarch
                    by twelve, to "demonstrate" that the "so called" years were really
                    "months" or "moons".</p>

                <p>When I went to the blackboard and divided by twelve the age at which
                    those patriarchs had their first son, the only argument that came to
                    his mind was to say: "Well, in different eras they counted time in
                    different ways". Then I replied: "We are talking about the same
                    passage, the same verse, and even the same man, not of different eras".</p>

                <p><strong>It is very common that the hypertrophic ego of many brothers preclude
                    them from rectifying in private, much less in public</strong>. This man was a
                    Christian, he was not trying to harm the faith. His problem was that
                    he had stuffed his mind with lots of pseudo scientific hypothesis.</p>

                <p>Sadly with the authority he had by virtue of being a medical doctor
                    and a Sunday School teacher, he was unwillingly harming the faith of
                    his brethren, who knew he was a scientist and an honest man. Sure
                    enough, <strong>he was honest, but was honestly wrong</strong>, and
                    <strong>the teachings of those brothers who are honestly wrong, are
                        the worst of all</strong>.</p>
