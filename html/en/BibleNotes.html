        <p>
            These Bible Notes are useful to understand some themes that God's enemies have tried
            to twist, or themes that are difficult to interpret. It is beneficial to read them.
            You can use all the material in here to help others, especially to help members of
            your church. We are going to add new Bible Notes as often as possible; therefore
            visit us frequently. <br><br>

            If you think I have a mistake in a Biblical Note, please, send me your opinion and
            the arguments that can back it up. I will appreciate it very much. I also like to
            learn from others.<br><br>

            Also if you would like some special issue to be addressed in a Biblical Note, just
            leave me a message at the following e-mail <br><br>

            address: ramonaleman@yahoo.com to R. L. Serralta Nogu√©s.
