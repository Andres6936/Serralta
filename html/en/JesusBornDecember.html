        <h2>Saying that Jesus could not be born in December is a lie.</h2>
    </header>
    <article class="posts">
        <p>It is false to say that Jesus could not be born in December.
            Those who are engaged in putting down Jesus use several tricks.
            Sadly many brothers have been taken into these traps. This is
            written to help those brothers.</p>

        <p>I am not saying that I can prove that Jesus was born in December,
            however I am saying that it is a lie that others can prove that
            Jesus was not born in December. The month of December can not be
            excluded, as many "scholars" endeavor to "prove". This is one
            of the many lies spread by the Russellites, wrongly called
            Jehovah's Witnesses, because they are not. Sadly many gullible
            Christians just swallow these lies without thinking.</p>

        <p>In 1998-1999 winter issue of "Life & Work Pursuits", a Christian
            quarterly, on page 35, lines 33-35 it says:</p>

        <p>"The Bible does not indicate the time of year Jesus was born. Most
            likely, since shepherds were in the field, his birth was in spring."</p>

        <p>On what basis is it said Jesus was not born in December as tradition
            states? Is there any proof ? No, they are just repeating what someone
            else invented. Tradition should be rejected when it opposes what the
            Bible teaches, the facts or the logic but not just because someone
            else tells us to reject it.</p>

        <p>Mohammed's Hegira occurred on Friday July 16, 622 AD, according to
            tradition. No one disputes it, because this tradition does not
            contradict facts or logic. Buddha, according to tradition, lived
            from 563 to 483 BC, nobody says any thing contrary to such tradition,
            they just simply believe it. There are hundreds of traditions that
            are accepted. Why not accept the tradition that Jesus was born
            December 25th? It does not harm anybody. It does not oppose any fact.
            It does not oppose logic. It does not oppose the Bible. Then, again,
            why do they go to such great lengths to oppose it ? Because everything
            that has to do with Jesus prompts the opposition of God's enemies.</p>

        <p>Russellists say that Jesus couldn't be born in December because
            the fields were covered with snow at that time. That is a big
            lie. Jesus' enemies take advantage of the ignorance of others to
            spread their lies. Israel is a long narrow country that extends
            along 390 miles from North to South. You can verify the data I
            state here in the Encyclopedia. The World Book Encyclopedia,
            copyright 1974, volume 10, page 390, when describing the climate
            of Israel says:</p>

        <p>"In January, the coolest month, temperatures average 45º F ( 7º C )
            in Northern Galilee, and 60º F ( 16º C ) in the Rift Valley.
            The Northern uplands have some days of freezing weather almost
            every winter. Rain falls almost entirely in winter, and
            generally decreases from North to South. Snow sometimes falls
            in Northern and central parts of Israel."</p>

        <p>As stated, January is the coolest month, not December. In the
            coolest month temperatures average 45º F ( 7º C ) just in
            the North. That temperature is not so cold that the shepherds
            can't stay outside. But more to the South, it averages 60º F
            ( 16º C ), still a more comfortable temperature even in January
            the coolest month. Therefore, December must be even warmer,
            because January is the coolest month.</p>

        <p>Only in the Northern uplands do freezing temperatures occur
            some days, not every single year, but almost every winter.
            Regarding snow it says that sometimes, ( not every year), snow
            falls in the Northern and central parts of Israel. Not in the
            South where Bethlehem is located.</p>

        <p>If we now go to volume 11, page 77, of the same encyclopedia
            we see that the temperature in Jerusalem, in January, which
            is the coolest month, average 55º F ( 13º C).
            Logically, December has to have a warmer temperature.
            Since Bethlehem is located about five miles South of
            Jerusalem (volume 2, page 214) it must have the same
            temperature.</p>

        <p>What wisdom is there in saying that the shepherds could
            not be in the field in December? Where is that field
            "full of snow" that Russellists are always saying that
            existed? Why do Christians have to be so gullible with
            falsehoods? I can not prove that Jesus was born in
            December, but that is what tradition says, and neither
            the Bible nor logic oppose to this tradition. Why then
            is it so fiercely attacked? Because they want to destroy
            Christianity from the inside out.</p>

        <p>Let us suppose that Bethlehem did have such cold winters.
            Padanaram, the region Rebekah was from, is located much
            more to the North than Bethlehem, where it is much colder.
            Let us see if the shepherds over there stayed with their
            cattle on winter nights. <br>

            When a problem arose between Jacob and Esau, Rebekah
            convinced Isaac to send Jacob to Padamaram for awhile.</p>

        <p>"And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto
            Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah,
            Jacob's and Esau's mother." (Gn 28: 5)</p>

        <p>Jacob stayed there for twenty years tending Laban's cattle.
            When he left he had an argument with Laban,
            his father-in-law, to whom he said:</p>

        <p>"38 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and
            thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of
            thy flock have I not eaten. 39 That which was torn of
            beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it;
            of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day,
            or stolen by night. 40 Thus I was; in the day the drought
            consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed
            from mine eyes."
            ( Gn 31: 38- 40 )</p>

        <p>From the words of Jacob we understand that even during
            extremely cold nights he stayed with the cattle in the
            field. And this happened for twenty years. Jacob says
            he used to do what Russellists say Bethlehem shepherds
            could not have done. And remember that this was not in
            Bethlehem with the temperature of just 60º F, ( 16º C)
            but it was up North, in a much colder climate. Therefore,
            it is not illogical that in Bethlehem the shepherds
            stayed in the fields at night in December. So it was
            not such a "difficult thing" for shepherds to stay with
            their cattle in the fields of Bethelehem even in cold
            winters.</p>

        <p>Another pseudo argument that is used to discredit Christmas,
            is saying that formerly it was the winter solstice pagan
            feast. This is also false. Christmas is on December 25th,
            while the winter solstice occur from the 21st to 22nd of
            December. <br>

            It is clear that all they want to do is to find fault so
            as to make Christians think that they are celebrating on
            a wrong date or welcoming a pagan feast. There have been
            hundreds of pagan countries through history, therefore there
            are thousands of pagan feasts. Every day of the year is
            the anniversary of some pagan feast. If it is not a feast
            of ancient Greeks, it is a feast of ancient Mayas, Aztecs,
            Incas, Chinese, Persians, Celts, Romans, etc., etc.. <br>

            If tradition, instead of celebrating Christ's birth on
            December 25th, they would celebrate it on any other day,
            they would also find some other pagan feast with which
            to smear and discredit it. What really hurts them is
            that even nominal Christians recognize Jesus' name. <br>

            It is sad brethren who go to seminaries to learn how
            to serve our Lord let themselves be cheated and be led
            astray by those who plot the "dischristianization" of
            Christendom.</p>

        <p>The "proof " that Jesus was not born in December, that
            Russellists and others try to hammer into the minds
            of many Christians, is not proof at all, it is just
            a lie.</p>

        <p>A big lie! </p>
