                <p><b>It is false to say that Jesus could not be born in December.</b>
                    Those who are engaged in putting down Jesus use several tricks.
                    Sadly many brothers have been taken into these traps. This is
                    written to help those brothers.</p>

                <p>I am not saying that I can prove that Jesus was born in December,
                    however I am saying that <b>it is a lie that others can prove that
                        Jesus was not born in December</b>. The month of December can not be
                    excluded, as many "scholars" endeavor to "prove". This is one
                    of the many lies spread by the Russellites, wrongly called
                    Jehovah's Witnesses, because they are not. Sadly many gullible
                    Christians just swallow these lies without thinking.</p>

                <p>In 1998-1999 winter issue of "Life & Work Pursuits", a Christian
                    quarterly, on page 35, lines 33-35 it says:</p>

                <p><b>"The Bible does not indicate the time of year Jesus was born.
                    <ins>Most
                        likely, since shepherds were in the field, his birth was in spring
                    </ins>
                    ."</b></p>

                <p>On what basis is it said Jesus was not born in December as tradition
                    states? Is there any proof ? No, they are just repeating what someone
                    else invented. <b>Tradition should be rejected when it opposes what the
                        Bible teaches, the facts or the logic</b> but not just because someone
                    else tells us to reject it.</p>

                <p><b>Mohammed's Hegira</b> occurred on Friday July 16, 622 AD, according to
                    tradition. No one disputes it, because this tradition does not
                    contradict facts or logic. <b>Buddha</b>, according to tradition, lived
                    from 563 to 483 BC, nobody says any thing contrary to such tradition,
                    they just simply believe it. <b>There are hundreds of traditions that
                        are accepted</b>. Why not accept the tradition that Jesus was born
                    December 25th? It does not harm anybody. It does not oppose any fact.
                    It does not oppose logic. <b>It does not oppose the Bible</b>. Then, again,
                    why do they go to such great lengths to oppose it ? <b>Because everything
                        that has to do with Jesus prompts the opposition of God's enemies.</b></p>

                <p><b>Russellists say that Jesus
                    <ins>couldn't</ins>
                    be born in December because the
                    <ins>fields were covered with snow</ins>
                    at that time.
                    <ins>That is a big lie</ins>
                    .</b> Jesus' enemies take advantage of the ignorance of others to
                    spread their lies. Israel is a long narrow country that extends
                    along 390 miles from North to South. You can verify the data I
                    state here in the Encyclopedia. The World Book Encyclopedia,
                    copyright 1974, volume 10, page 390, when describing the climate
                    of Israel says:
                </p>

                <p>"<b>In January, the coolest month, temperatures average 45º F ( 7º C )
                    in Northern Galilee, and 60º F ( 16º C ) in the Rift Valley</b>.
                    The Northern uplands have some days of freezing weather <b>almost</b>
                    every winter. Rain falls almost entirely in winter, and
                    generally decreases from North to South. <b>Snow
                        <ins>sometimes</ins>
                        falls
                        in Northern and central parts of Israel.</b>"
                </p>

                <p>As stated, January is the coolest month, not December. In the
                    coolest month temperatures average 45º F ( 7º C ) just in
                    the North. That temperature is not so cold that the shepherds
                    can't stay outside. But more to the South, it averages 60º F
                    ( 16º C ), still a more comfortable temperature even in January
                    the coolest month. <b>Therefore, December must be even warmer</b>,
                    because January is the coolest month.</p>

                <p><b>Only in the Northern uplands</b> do freezing temperatures occur
                    <b>
                        <ins>some</ins>
                        days</b>, not every single year, but <b>almost</b> every winter.
                    Regarding snow it says that sometimes, ( not every year), snow
                    falls in the Northern and central parts of Israel. <b>Not in the
                        South where Bethlehem is located</b>.
                </p>

                <p>If we now go to volume 11, page 77, of the same encyclopedia
                    we see that the temperature <b>in Jerusalem, in January, which
                        is the coolest month, average 55º F ( 13º C).</b>
                    Logically, December has to have a warmer temperature.
                    Since Bethlehem is located about five miles South of
                    Jerusalem (volume 2, page 214) it must have the same
                    temperature.</p>

                <p>What wisdom is there in saying that the shepherds could
                    not be in the field in December? <b>Where is that field
                        "full of snow" that Russellists are always saying that
                        existed? Why do Christians have to be so gullible with
                        falsehoods?</b> I can not prove that Jesus was born in
                    December, but that is what tradition says, and neither
                    the Bible nor logic oppose to this tradition. <b>Why then
                        is it so fiercely attacked?</b> Because they want to destroy
                    Christianity from the inside out.</p>

                <p><b>Let us
                    <ins>suppose</ins>
                    that Bethlehem did have such cold winters.</b>
                    Padanaram, the region Rebekah was from, is located much
                    more to the North than Bethlehem, where it is much colder.
                    <b>Let us see if the shepherds over there stayed with their
                        cattle on winter nights.</b><br>

                    When a problem arose between Jacob and Esau, Rebekah
                    convinced Isaac to send Jacob to Padamaram for awhile.
                </p>

                <p class="text-italic font-family-serif">"And Isaac sent away Jacob: and
                    <ins>he went to Padanaram</ins>
                    unto
                    Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah,
                    Jacob's and Esau's mother." (Gn 28: 5)
                </p>

                <p>Jacob stayed there for twenty years tending Laban's cattle.
                    When he left he had an argument with Laban,
                    his father-in-law, to whom he said:</p>

                <p class="text-italic font-family-serif">"38 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and
                    thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of
                    thy flock have I not eaten. 39 That which was torn of
                    beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it;
                    of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day,
                    or stolen by night. 40 Thus I was; in the day the drought
                    consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed
                    from mine eyes."
                    ( Gn 31: 38- 40 )</p>

                <p>From the words of Jacob we understand that <b>even during
                    extremely cold nights he stayed with the cattle in the
                    field.</b> And this happened for twenty years. Jacob says
                    he used to do what Russellists say Bethlehem shepherds
                    could not have done. And remember that this was not in
                    Bethlehem with the temperature of just 60º F, ( 16º C)
                    but it was up North, in a much colder climate. Therefore,
                    it is not illogical that in Bethlehem the shepherds
                    stayed in the fields at night in December. So it was
                    not such a "difficult thing" for shepherds to stay with
                    their cattle in the fields of Bethelehem even in cold
                    winters.</p>

                <p><b>Another pseudo argument that is used to discredit Christmas,
                    is saying that formerly it was the winter solstice pagan
                    feast.</b> This is also false. Christmas is on December 25th,
                    while the winter solstice occur from the 21st to 22nd of
                    December. <br>

                    <b>It is clear that all they want to do is to find fault</b> so
                    as to make Christians think that they are celebrating on
                    a wrong date or welcoming a pagan feast. There have been
                    hundreds of pagan countries through history, therefore there
                    are thousands of pagan feasts. Every day of the year is
                    the anniversary of some pagan feast. If it is not a feast
                    of ancient Greeks, it is a feast of ancient Mayas, Aztecs,
                    Incas, Chinese, Persians, Celts, Romans, etc., etc.. <br>

                    If tradition, instead of celebrating Christ's birth on
                    December 25th, they would celebrate it on any other day,
                    they would also find some other pagan feast with which
                    to smear and discredit it. What really hurts them is
                    that even nominal Christians recognize Jesus' name. <br>

                    <b>It is sad brethren who go to seminaries to learn how
                        to serve our Lord let themselves be cheated and be led
                        astray by those who plot the "dischristianization" of
                        Christendom.</b></p>

                <p>The "proof " that Jesus was not born in December, that
                    Russellists and others try to hammer into the minds
                    of many Christians, is not proof at all, <b>it is just
                        a lie.</b></p>
