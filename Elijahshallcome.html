<center><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+2>Elijah the
prophet shall come before the Second Coming of the Lord</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=+1>Then, what about
John the Baptist?</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is said very
clearly in the Bible that the Prophet Elijah, who never died, will return
a little before the Second Coming of Christ.&nbsp; In the same way that
the disciples in Jesus' time were confounded because they didn't see Elijah
coming before the Messiah (Christ), so many modern Christians are confused
believing that Elijah was John the Baptist. This prophet was not Elijah,
as he himself clearly states in John 1: 21.</font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font></i>
<center>
<p><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"And they asked him, What then?
<b>Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not</b>."</font></i></center>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If John the Baptist
really was Elijah he would not have denied it.&nbsp; John the Baptist came
in the spirit and power of Elijah, as says Luke 1: 17, and that is why
Jesus said that he was "the Elijah"&nbsp; that was going to come before
the Lord in his First Advent.&nbsp; Nevertheless, even that Jesus himself
said that John the Baptist was the "Elijah-like" prophet that was to come
in his First Advent, still near the Second Coming of the Lord, the true
Elijah shall come again. Let us see what Jesus said regarding that issue.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"<i><font size=-2>10</font> And his disciples asked him, saying:&nbsp;
Why then say the scribes that Elias</i></font>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
must first come?&nbsp; <font size=-2>11 </font>And Jesus answered and said
unto them, <b>Elias truly <u>shall</u></b></font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
first come,</b> and restore all things. <font size=-2>12</font> But I say
unto you, that Elias is come already,</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
shall also the Son of man suffer of them.&nbsp; <font size=-2>13 </font>Then
the disciples understood that</font></i>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
he spake unto them of John the Baptist."</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Matthew 17: 10-13.)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone I know
interprets from this passage that John the Baptist was the Elijah that
was prophesied.&nbsp; But as far as I know no one interprets from that
passage that <b>Jesus said clearly that Elijah <u>shall</u> come (future)
and shall restore (future again) all things.&nbsp;</b> Note that when referring
to the true Elijah, Jesus speaks in future tense (shall come; shall restore),
but when referring to John the Baptist he speaks in the past tense (is
come already; knew him not).</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From this
passage we can deduce, without forcing the argument, that <b>Christ admitted
that Elijah was yet to come.</b>&nbsp; But this is not all.&nbsp; Let's
go on to read the original prophecies; lets read Malachi 3:1, where John
the Baptist's mission during the First Coming of the Lord, is prophesized,
and later let's read Malachi 4: 5-6 where Elijah's coming before the Second
Coming of the Lord, is prophesized.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"<i>Behold, I will send <b>my messenger</b>, and he shall prepare the way
before me: and</i></font>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>the Lord,</b> whom ye seek, <b>shall suddenly <u>come to his temple</u></b></font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">…"
(Malachi 3:1)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this verse
the one whose coming and mission Malachi is talking about <b>is called
"my messenger".&nbsp; He doesn't call him Elijah.</b> Besides, Malachi
says very clearly that the messenger's mission is to prepare the way before
Christ, and that
<b>after such a <u>pacific mission</u> is that Christ
would come <u>to his temple</u>.</b>&nbsp; The prophet talks of the "messenger"
as a man who is going to come during the time that Jesus would enter in
the Second Temple. <b>A messenger that was going to come in a time in which
people <u>could still enter in the Second Temple,</u></b> because it was
not destroyed. (The Temple was destroyed in year 70 AD).</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This messenger
didn't come in a mission of punishment, but in a mission of announcing
and preparing
<b>the pacific First Coming of Our Lord</b> .&nbsp; The other
prophecy is very different. Let us see.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"<i>Behold, <b>I will send you Elijah the prophet</b> before the coming
of
<b>the great</b></i></font>
<br><b><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and <u>dreadful</u> day of the LORD.</font></i></b><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;
He shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children,</font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest <b>I come and <u>smite
the earth</u> with</b></font></i>
<br><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a curse</b>.</font></i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Malachi 4: 5-6.)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here we see a
very different picture.&nbsp; <b><u>First</u></b> he calls the messenger
by his personal name,
<b>he calls him Elijah.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; <b><u>Second</u></b>,
in order to avoid any doubt he clarifies that he refers <b>to "the prophet",
in case that anyone could think of another Elijah</b>.&nbsp; <b><u>Third</u></b>,
Malachi specifies that <b>Elijah's mission is going to take place before
the coming of the great and <u>dreadful</u> day of the LORD.</b>&nbsp;
That description does not depict the First Coming of Christ.&nbsp; His
First Coming was an event extremely pacific, devoid of dramatics and dreadfulness,
contrary to his Second Coming, which will be full of both dramatics and
dreadfulness.&nbsp; In his First Coming, Christ didn't come to smite or
destroy the earth, but instead to save it, to suffer for it.&nbsp; Therefore
Malachi cannot be talking in this passage about John the Baptist during
the First Coming of Christ, <b>but about Elijah before the Second Coming
of the Lord.</b></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the study
of both passages we can conclude that Malachi is talking about two different
individuals who were going to have a similar mission ( to be forerunners),
each one in very different times and circumstances.&nbsp; The first one
is John the Baptist, in the time of Christ's First Coming; the second one
is Elijah the Prophet, in latter times, near the Second Coming.&nbsp; When
Jesus identifies John the Baptist in Matthew 11:10, he identifies him using
the words found in Malachi 3:1, never the words used in Malachi 4: 5-6.
Let's see:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"<i>For this is he, of whom it is written: 'Behold, I send <b>my messenger</b>
before</i></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee'.</i>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Matthew 11:10)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This passage from
Matthew confirms that it is Malachi 3:1 the one that talks about John the
Baptist and not Malachi 4:5-6.</font>
