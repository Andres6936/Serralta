<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Marriages
between angels and women is just an absurd, ridiculous, heretical, and
blasphemous teaching</span></b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Russellists have fabricated the blasphemous teaching
that once there was a time in which many angels married women</b>. This is totally
false. Angels have neither power nor wisdom to create a human body; nor would
God cooperate with them by creating a body with the sole purpose to commit such
a horrid sin. In the &quot;Watchtower&quot;, a magazine of the Russellists,
they often present this teaching. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to support their error they present&nbsp; Gn
1-4, from which they have far fetched their fabrication. Sadly, they have
&quot;infected&quot; true Christians, who are now believing the filthy idea.
According to the &quot;Governing Body&quot; of the Russellists, a great number
of angels, some how, incarnated themselves, and had &quot;sons&quot; with
regular women. <b>Not true</b>. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To prop their teaching, Russellists allege that in Job 1:
6 the angels are called &quot;sons of God&quot;, therefore, <b>necessarily</b>,
those who were called &quot;sons of God&quot; in Genesis, have to also be
angels. Let's first demonstrate biblically, and later using common sense, that
this is another lie. </p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.2in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.2in;
margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;<i>1 And it
came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and
daughters were born unto them, 2 <b>that the sons of God saw</b> the daughters
of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. 3
<b>And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive <u>with man</u></b>,
for that he also is flesh; yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years. 4
<b><u>There were giants in the earth in those days</u>;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>and also
after that</u>, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men</b>, and
they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men
of renown. 5 And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and
that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved
him at his heart</i>.&quot; ( Gn 6: 1-4 ) </p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.2in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.2in;
margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.2in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.2in;
margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;<i>Now there
was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, <b>and
Satan came also among them</b></i>.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Job 1: 6 ) </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>In the Bible, human beings have been called&nbsp;
&quot;sons of God&quot;&nbsp; many times more than the angels</b>. Why then do
the Russellists make believe that in&nbsp; Gn 6: 1-4 the phrase &quot;sons of
God&quot; refers to angels and not men? </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Most probably, these men were called&nbsp; &quot;sons
of God&quot;,&nbsp; and these women were called &quot;daughters of men&quot;,
meaning that</b> men who were believers and pious, married women who were
unbelievers, carnal, sensual, and given to the flesh. Men did so because these
women were gorgeous, beautiful, and paid no attention to their faith, and
subsequently their soul. This interpretation of&nbsp; Gn 6: 1-2 agrees with the
complaint God expresses in verse 3.&nbsp; Certainly so, after saying in verse 2
the wrongs of the so called &quot;sons of God&quot;, God said: &quot;<i>My
spirit shall not always strive <b>with man</b></i>&#8230;&quot;. <b>We see that
God did not mention angels</b>, who, in this case, would be the main subjects
of the problem, ( if truly this teaching was right.) </p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.2in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.2in;
margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;&#8230; <b><i>the
sons of God saw</i></b><i> the daughters of men that they were fair; and they
took them wives of all which they chose. <b>And the LORD said, My spirit shall
not always strive <u>with man</u></b>, for that he also is flesh; yet his days
shall be an hundred and twenty years</i>.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
( Gn 6: 2-3 ) </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Something else to consider, is that verse 2 does not
say that &quot;the sons of God&quot; took a body of flesh and bones</b>, as to
be able to have sexual relations with women. It comes with the territory that
if the phrase &quot;sons of God&quot; would refer to angels, the writer would
explain that they took a body, because he had to know that no one would
otherwise understand how an angel could have sex with a woman. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>It is far more logical to admit that the problem was
caused by the believer's blinded lechery, leading them to marry without any
regard for their religion</b>. Because of the fact that every believer had taken
this wrong path, we see that God considered it better to destroy that society,
and start another with Noah, who was a man of great qualities. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Now, to understand what I am about to say, it is
necessary to realize that the 5th chapter of Genesis is a list of genealogies,
inserted between&nbsp; Gn 4: 26 and 6: 1</b>.&nbsp; If you jump from verse 4:
26 to 6: 1 you will not notice an interruption, but on the contrary, reading
becomes more sequential and fluent. You will even see that chapter 5 begin by
stating: &quot;This is the book of the generations of Adam&quot;. This was
probably a parchment inserted between Gn 4: 26 and 6: 1. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After understanding this previous explanation we realize
that subsequent to saying in verse 4: 26 &quot;<b><i>And to Seth, to him also
there was born a son; and he called his name Enos. Then men began to call upon
the name of the LORD&quot;</i></b>, right afterwards in 6: 1-2 we see the
complaint that &quot;the sons of God&quot; (descendants of faithful Enos, those
who called themselves by the name of the Lord ), married the daughters of men,
( those who did not call themselves by the name of the Lord, maybe because they
were descendants of Cain ). The importance of the problem is that by marrying
believers to non believers, the society was going to corrupt entirely. All this
proves that the phrase &quot;sons of God&quot; referred to men who were
believers, and the phrase &quot;daughters of men&quot; referred to women who
were unbelievers. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>It will become evident that human-beings are called
&quot;sons of God&quot; over and over again, just by reading</b>&nbsp;
Psalm&nbsp; 82: 6;&nbsp; Hosea 1: 10; Ro 8: 14, 16, 19 &amp; 21; 9: 26; Gal 3:
26; 4: 6; Philippians 2: 15 and many others. </p>

midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the
world</i>.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( Phil 2: 15 ) </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>After considering all these biblical arguments, let's
now use our common sense. <i>Neither demons, nor any creature can create
anything</i></b>. A demon cannot create a human body, <b>give life to each cell</b>,
produce genital organs, make spermatozoids with chromosomes, genes, DNA, etc.,
to later introduce himself in that body, and have children with a woman, as
said by the Russellists. This simply is not true. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Russellists also claim that according to&nbsp; Gn 6: 4,
the sexual participation of demons, began the existence of giants on the Earth.
<b>This again is false. Otherwise all the children of demon-possessed men would
be giants, something we know is not true.</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Russellists have not noticed that in this very verse it
says that <b>the giants existed <u>before</u></b> the sons of God married the
daughters of men, and also after it. </p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.2in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.2in;
margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;<b><i><u>There
were giants in the earth in those days</u></i></b><i>;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>and
also after that</u>, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men</b>,
and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old,
men of renown</i>.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( Gn 6: 4 ) </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we know, during the Creation, God created <b>only one
man, Adam</b>. According to the Russellists, God restarted His work with a
second creation, <b>but this time, instead of creating one man, He created
thousands of them, and to boot, God created them with better genes than Adam,
because their offspring were giants</b>. Absurd!! </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something else to realize is that if these supposed
demons, incarnated along a long period of time, then it have to be concluded
that God worked for years or decades creating bodies for these abominable
beings, instead of working only one day as when He created Adam. Absurd. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Let's see another absurd claimed by Russellists. They
insist that there is no soul, but only flesh.&nbsp; According to that,
feelings, character and personality are just in the brain and not in the soul</b>.
If this was so, then they would have to admit the following: <b>a)</b> These
newly created bodies, which were fashioned especially for demons, <b>had a
brain</b>. In which case they were regular men, with their own individuality,
feelings, and human personality, created by God, with the only purpose of being
possessed by a demon. This is a blaspheme against God.&nbsp; <b>b)</b> The
other alternative is that, to preclude those bodies from having a human
personality, <b>they were created without brains</b>. In this case they have to
believe the bizarre idea of a human body that performs perfectly well without a
brain. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>In short, to think that this teaching is true means
one of two: 1)</b> either rebellious angels have a power and a wisdom equal to
God, or&nbsp; <b>2)</b> God agreed with these demons in creating a body for
them for the sole purpose of committing this horrid sin. Both ideas equally
absurd and blasphemous. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This idea of &quot;materialization&quot; of angels must
be related to the materialization of the spirits, as seen in the believers of
spiritualism. </p>
